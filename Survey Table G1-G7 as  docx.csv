"—busy, busy, per usual.",Always. [Laughter],G3
"Yeah, [laughter] no joke. We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of the implementation of lung ultrasound. You have been asked to be interviewed because of your role in POCUS—in lung ultrasound implementation. Interviews will be de-identified, recorded, and transcribed and analyzed. Do you consent to being interviewed?",Yes.,G3
What is your professional job title and description?,"Division administrator. The description. Oh, goodness. [Laughter] I am responsible for the financial and—the financial management of the division and also oversight of the administrative staff and operations. Everything that we do [laughter] that is not taking care of patients.",G3
[Laughter] That’s not actual clinical decision-making?,[Laughter],G3
That was my impression.,"I, at least, have some involvement with everything else that we do that is not clinical.",G3
Perfect. Good. You’re gonna be able to give me a nice big-picture view. Tell me a little bit about your current experience with point-of-care ultrasound and lung ultrasound.,"A big part of it is looking at the finances, of course. Seeing, is this ever gonna cover its expenses or, at some point, become profitable? What I’ve seen so far is that we’re not gonna cover the expenses in clinical revenue. It’s not gonna happen ’cause the collection rate is just too low. It’s not that different from our general collection rate. A lot of the ultrasound charges are reimbursed under global billing for some insurers. It’s not broken out. Likely, there is some other benefit that we just can’t tease out from the rest of the global billing. 	The other piece that I’ve seen, that I’ve been a little bit involved in, is the point-of-care ultrasound training courses. I’ve been set up with that.",G3
"Can you back up and just talk about the global billing? You are so great about sending me that info every week. What I see is we’re—they bill a certain amount, and then we collect, it looks like, about 23 bucks per scan. Can you talk about this term “global billing?” What is that about?","For some insurance companies, there are certain codes, certain procedure codes or diagnosis—I’m blanking on the term. The CPT codes that fall under what they call global billing. You could have a visit for, let’s say, surgery, is the easiest example, for any kind of surgery. All of the other pieces, like the pre-op appointment, the post-operative care, all of that falls under a global bill. It covers pre- and post-op. It covers their stay. It covers complications that might come up with that stay. The insurance company pays one big global—",G3
"It’s the DRG thing, the bundled payment that you’re talking about for—",Right.,G3
"My understanding—and you can correct me—is that there’s the—basically, for, I think, all—certainly, all radiology tests and, I think, some other diagnostics and some other services is there’s a facility fee and then there’s a professional fee.",Yep.,G3
"I found what we were seeing that $23 is the professional fee that we’re reimbursing. Is that what you mean? We’re losing the facility fee, and so because of that, we’ll never—it just won’t ever be able to generate revenue, significant revenue.","That’s part of it. The $23 that we’re seeing is only the professional service fee, the professional part of that. I asked our clinical revenue liaison to see why—it just seems like such a tiny amount of money—[Laughter]",G3
"I see. Just to clarify. Sorry. We know we’re getting that revenue. Then, you’re saying that there may be another piece that we’re getting that we’ll never be able to know about, essentially.",Exactly. We can’t measure it because it just comes through as other general professional service reimbursement.,G3
When you say that the ultrasound—can you talk to me about the cost that you associate with the ultrasound stuff we’re doing?,"From my side of it, what I see for the direct cost is the equipment. Which the hospital is covering or has covered most of that for us, of course, but there are other pieces to that. There’s the time, especially … time, getting the iPad set up, that kind of thing, figuring out the tracking for it, getting the lockers, setting all of that up. The admin time cost on top of the actual physical equipment cost. We still have to figure out exactly how this is gonna work after this first year is up. There’s a subscription fee, too, for—I can’t remember now. Was it for the butterflies?",G3
"For the butterflies, yeah.","I think it was the first year was rolled into the cost of the equipment. Then moving beyond that, since the hospital paid for that, we never saw any charge for that. I don't know if they’re planning to pay for that long term, or if that will eventually be a cost that falls to us. I haven’t reached out yet because I don’t want them to dig into it.",G3
"Yeah, don’t.[Laughter]",[No Reply],G3
"Let’s get our game plan in place first. Absolutely. Okay, good. Well, that’s good information for me to know, too. Then, are any other costs that you see associated with the ultrasound stuff?","Outside of training, your time to teach people how to use it—because that is a significant piece, doing those training courses. It’s not even just the two-day course that we were doing. There’s a lot of prep that goes into that. All of that costs as well. That’s just time.",G3
"One of the things we were hoping to do is piggyback onto the procedure service to facilitate the teaching. Can you talk to me—and the fact that procedures are so well reimbursed would help support—lump that together so that there’s, basically, protection for the faculty. They’re doing these procedures that are reimbursed for the time they’re spending. That will free up some of the time to teach and do diagnostics, which are lower-revenue things. What do you see about the feasibility of that structure?",Having point-of-care ultrasound training as part of the procedure service?,G3
"Yeah. I guess that goes to the financial feasibility of the procedure service. We have such a big division that that was our idea, was that there would always be somebody there that could either get the ultrasounds or train the faculty. That’s part of our sustainability plan. I guess, it goes to the financial feasibility of the procedure service. Right now, they’re also taking care of patients. They can’t really teach the way we—or even do some of these diagnostic studies. They don’t have the bandwidth because of the patient care responsibilities. I wanted to get your opinion about that. Going forward, how close we are to—will we ever be able to have a procedure service where it’s just procedures, you think?",I happened to find that for you. We do that report monthly. Let me look at the most recent one.,G3
"I’d always been told by my colleagues who have started multiple procedure service—’cause that’s a national trend, where you tie the procedures to—you tie the diagnostics to procedures. In the places that have implemented it, the few places, they’ve always done it that because of the revenue stream. I was told that you need six—you basically need six procedures a day to support an attending-run procedure service.","Yeah. It covers about, roughly, half of what it costs to have somebody on that service, the revenue that we’re getting back from procedures.",G3
Right now.,"That we’re getting so far. This is July through November. December books just closed, so I haven’t re-run this report yet. Looking at July through November data, yeah, it covers about half of the cost of having somebody on that service. It’s not quite self-sufficient yet. However, if we were able to, like you said, take off the patient care and just do procedures and increase the number of procedures, I think that would be helpful.",G3
How many procedures are you guys doing now? I’m just curious to know what the targets are.,"This looks like 136 a month, roughly.",G3
"Okay, good. I can do the math, then. You see, potentially, if the volume, basically, doubles from what it is now—",Then it would be a self-sufficient service.,G3
- then that’s where we’re at.,We would need to do about nine a day or four and a half.,G3
"The pandemic shut down our training courses, but we’re getting a lot of… will tell you, we’re getting tons of emails.","Perspective, from what I’ve—I look at the clinical revenue data all the time. [Laughter] The training courses and offering that as a paid enterprise, [laughter] that’s where we’re gonna be [laughter 11:20]. It’s never gonna be in the clinical revenue. We’re just not gonna collect enough, I don’t think. Unless we can really crank through nine procedures a day—or it would have to be, probably, 10 procedures a day to be profitable.",G3
Ten diagnostic studies.,Sorry. I’m looking at the procedure service numbers.,G3
"Oh, for the procedure service, it’d be—you’d need 10 to be profitable. Then that would allow—and then it would pay for some of… time and that stuff. I see what you’re saying.",I think the training classes are really where we’re gonna be able to make some money.,G3
At least cover costs.,"At least cover costs and be able to also protect time for [unintelligible 12:08] review the trainings and that kind of thing. The last courses that we did, it wasn’t—",G3
Big enough.,"Had we been able to do that May class, I think it would have. We would have at least broken even, maybe even a little bit extra to cover some of … time. We just didn’t get there. I think that that has a much better chance. The taxes are also different. Clinical revenue gets taxed by everybody. The teaching thing, there’s just less tax on that by quite a bit. We’re at 28 percent tax on the clinical revenue, but I think the GAR was nine percent or eight percent, maybe. The taxes that we have to pay on that money coming in is just so much lower that we’re able to keep a lot more of that revenue.",G3
"That $23 that we’re seeing—I’m just thinking, too, for generalizability for the rest of hospital medicine who’s trying to do what we’re doing, and they don’t even have—they don’t even have this initial billing data yet. It’s nice we have that, so we can extrapolate a little bit. If we actually had more providers doing it on their own—’cause, really, the point-of-care ultrasound is about the clinician who’s taking care of the patient. It’s not the procedure service coming and doing it. This is, hopefully, just a bridge to having everybody using it on their patients and feeling comfortable using it. Based on the indications for lung ultrasound, for a group our size, I feel like, if we had more people using it, we could hit 10 diagnostic studies a day. Are you saying that even with—and that’s $230 a day collected. Are the taxes such that that even isn’t necessarily gonna translate to, for instance, protected—a 10 percent FTE for somebody to quality assess those in the course of a year?","We would get back from that—we’d essentially get 82 percent on that. We would get about $66,000 a year.",G3
"You could pay a couple people to—hopefully, I’m translating this correctly. If it was 66,00, then that’s, what, I don't know, a 0.3 FTE or something like that or 0.2 or something.","I would think about—it depends on the person. There’s some variability. That would get you about, probably, 0.25 FTE, around there.",G3
"Okay, good. I just wanna know that I, roughly, understood those calculations. We talked about the financial aspects. Any other hidden costs that I’m not thinking of that we haven’t talked about?",Not that I can think of. The taxes are [laughter] the ones—that one kills us. It’s just a lot.,G3
"For that $23, what would we actually see after taxes?","We actually get 82 percent of that. I’m tryin’ to think of where—hold on. Lemme just make sure that this does not include—the report that I’m running, I don’t think it has any of the taxes.",G3
"Taxes, yeah.","Yeah. No, this all pre-taxed. We would take 82 percent of that. That’s what we get from CU Medicine. Then, the Department of Medicine has their piece of that as well.",G3
Right. Then we essentially tithe to the department.,"Yeah. Some of it goes to CU Medicine. Some of it goes to the dean, to the School of Medicine. Then some of it goes to the Department of Medicine. I think I said 28 percent, but that’s not right. Hang on. Sorry.",G3
"That’s okay. No, that’s okay. This is all really good information. I’ll probably have you break it—show me in a spreadsheet, at some point, where those—I’ll be doing a—we’ll be doing a costing study, where we’re looking at all of these hidden—these costs that aren’t totally obvious to anyone but you, essentially. [Laughter]",It is 28 percent. Sorry. Dean’s tax is 10 percent. The department chair tax is 10 percent. The CU Medicine billing fee is eight percent.,G3
"Right. That can all change, I’m guessing, depending on who the leadership is, or is that pretty standard?","I don’t think that’s gonna change in our university system. If you’re looking at publishing this nationally or something, other institutions are gonna have different outcomes.",G3
Setups.,"Well, I don't know the exact structure, but I think because Denver Health is one entity, they don’t have a separate billing company, they don’t have a separate—it’s one thing. It’s not a university hospital billing company. I think it’s probably different for them. They also have to cover all of their administrative costs out of that one bucket. It’s just split differently. I don't know exactly what their tax percentage is. Eighty-two percent is what the whole—what all clinical revenue is taxed. We have that additional 10 percent because we live under the Department of Medicine.	When I worked in neurology, we did not have—it was just 82 percent that we got back. We had just the 18 percent tax that go to the dean and CU Medicine. Here, we also pay our taxes to the department. It just depends on the structure you’re in. If we were to, someday, become our own department, we wouldn’t have that extra 10 percent. That would just be ours.",G3
"That makes sense. How does the division of—anything that increases our revenue, the department would like. Then, in terms of the professional fees, how does that—what does the hospital think about that? Are they agnostic to that? It’s not really, necessarily, money they’re seeing, the professional fees. How does that work?","The way it works is the professional service fees that we collect go to cover our costs. They go to cover physician salaries. What is left of that—we take our cost, our total cost. We take out the clinical revenue, what we collect in professional service fees. Then the hospital pays the rest. They fill in the gap. The more money that we can collect in professional service fees, the less they have to offset.",G3
Nice.,"Even if they’re not directly seeing any profit from the professional service fee revenue, they’re—it’s less expense to them.",G3
Got it.,"I think, if there are any facility fees associated with [unintelligible 19:25], I just don’t know. I only look at the professional service fees. I imagine that there’s some portion of facility charge for each of these as well.",G3
"They’re all DRG, though, for us.","The hospital does get that, and it does get attributed to those patients that are on an in-patient medicine service.",G3
"Let me throw some numbers at you. I have been doing little discussions with radiology and radiography as well because lung ultrasound is, potentially, a replacement study for some situations. Every stakeholder wants there to be less chest X-rays, except for the clinicians ordering them, [laughter] essentially. They order 50,000 in our hospital a year. Radiography actually did its own little micro-costing study or analysis where they calculated that the hospital—it cost about $30 per chest X-ray in a DRG environment because you’ve got to pay the technician and the radiologist. Radiology, when they charge for them, I guess they get reimbursed a dollar—less than $2 for a chest X-ray. This is what the radiologists are telling me.	One of the other ways you can demonstrate value is by increasing efficiencies like that. Lung ultrasound, which you can get quicker, is more accurate, blah, blah, blah. No radiation. Patients love it. If you can get folks using it and then decreasing this other low-value test, would that be compelling, do you think? Is that a big enough attraction to administrators and people making decisions about supporting infrastructure and so forth?","It depends on the total dollar value. How much money would that save? Would it be enough to decrease their staff pool? Would it save them an entire T or two? In which case, probably. Probably, it’s a pretty compelling argument to them. Not so much for the people who are in those positions, who are not gonna have a job.",G3
"It’s funny. When I talked to radiography, they were like, “What we would do is if half of the chest X-rays went away, no one would—we would be fine. We would be happy. We would probably just cut down on people’s hours. We wouldn’t necessarily have to”—which I don't know. I just wanted to throw that out there ’cause I thought was an interesting take.","They might be having people work overtime, just like we do with our moonlighting shifts because it’s less—it’s cost effective to do that to an extent. There comes a point where people are just not gonna sign up for extra shifts anymore ’cause there’s too much. It is more cost effective to have some amount of moonlighting. I wonder if that’s what they’re doing, allowing people to pick up extra shifts for extra money so that they’re not overcommitted on their FTE, and they wouldn’t have to lay anybody off. It probably would save them money because they’re not paying for those extra shifts, at least to some extent. They wouldn’t be paying for those extra shifts. If they’re being reimbursed so poorly for these, then it’s probably costing some of their profit anyway to pay for those extra shifts. That makes sense.",G3
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to cut you off if you had a thought. I’m trying to remember what question I had asked you.,I can’t remember now what it was anyway.,G3
[Laughter] Sorry about that.,[Laughter] No worries.,G3
"I guess, in your experience, is it really about sitting—it’s really about, granularly, this is what you’re gonna save if we do this. This is what this cost. This is what this cost. If you implement this and it either covers the cost that we’re spending now, or it improves the cost and maybe adds to patient satisfaction, then that’s the thing that’s greenlighted, to a certain extent?","Usually. You have at least the best chance with that. If you can present—if we move forward with this, it’s gonna cost you this much money, but it’s gonna save you this much money, and also, your patient satisfaction scores should increase because you’re saving people having to get a chest X-ray, then, yeah, that’s a pretty compelling argument, depending on exactly what those numbers look like. That could be a pretty compelling argument to the hospital. They care a lot about, obviously, the bottom line. Also, those patient satisfaction scores are really important for them, too. 	If you can do both, [laughter] even if you’re not really moving the moving significantly, but if it’s something that’s gonna both save them money and increase patient satisfaction scores—or even if it doesn’t necessarily save money but it’s a breakeven or only costs a little bit but increases the patient satisfaction, I think you’ve still got a pretty good chance of winning that argument.",G3
"Even if there’s an up—the ask would be support for—more support for provider training. We have a small ask for—a relatively small ask for some middleware software that would allow us to better teach. There are some upfront costs that we would want—would need to be in place to see those benefits longer term. Is that something that they’re used to seeing as an investment, essentially?","Yeah. Usually, when we submit proposals to them, we do it on a three-year basis. We say, “Here’s how much it’s gonna cost you in the first year, second year, third year.” If they can see that there’s an investment out front, in that first year, it’s gonna cost a little bit more, but then in the next two years, it’s gonna decrease dramatically, then they’re looking at that whole picture. You’ve got a better chance there. Usually, what we’re saying is it’s gonna cost pretty much the same for three years. Actually, it’ll increase a little bit with salary increases.	Mostly we’re looking at just increasing FTE, but for programmatic things, there’s always gonna be some additional upfront cost. If you can show that it will decrease in subsequent years, I think that’s a pretty strong argument.",G3
"I think they know that this is where we’re moving, regardless. That’s helpful.","I think that is another piece of it, too, to say, “We wanna be at the forefront of this and not playing catch-up five years from now.” Not necessarily breaking the ground on it, but we wanna be leading, be one of the national experts in this. We want other people to look to us as a model for how to roll this out. I think that helps, too, because it brings recognition to the hospital. That’s something that they could market and that they could really praise the clinicians for and really make the hospital look good.",G3
"Patient satisfaction, national reputation, obviously the cost. We can make those arguments—those are a little bit harder to get at, and we need a certain amount of implementation of the tool before we can actually show that data. There is data from other centers. People have published on the fact that if you implement point-of-care ultrasound in your ICU and everybody feels comfortable using it, you don’t get as many echoes. You don’t get as many CAT scans or X-rays. How compelling is data from other places in this initial investment?","We always try to present national benchmarks on things, or whatever information we have about other places who have done something similar when we have it. I will say, it doesn’t always help the case. It depends on what you see. If you have really strong cases from other institutions that have already done this and it’s been successful, I think it would help. If it’s, “Other groups have tried it and they’ve seen some success,” and it’s more lukewarm results, then I would just leave it out. If there are really compelling cases that there’s proof that their patient satisfaction went up, their efficiency went up, they’ve reduced their cost, I think, definitely include that.",G3
"Clinical practice guidelines and actual randomized controlled trial results and stuff, is that often presented in these sorts or things, or not really?","I’m not sure. We haven’t done a whole lot with that. We did for addiction medicine, but then that ended up not being approved at the hospital level anyway. We got it through the UPL grant. I think there just—there was some amount of research, but not enough to make the case strong enough for them to agree to it.",G3
"There’s some pilot grants for quality improvement stuff and everything. Is there another mechanism by which people get, basically, support for a pilot?","UPL has been the one funding source that I’ve seen for that, in the clinical realm.",G3
What is UPL?,"It’s the upper-payment limit. It’s something to do with—we have hit certain CMS metrics, and then we get a reimbursement because there’s an upper-payment limit with CMS. I can’t remember the credentials. You have to have a certain number of CMS patients. Medicare and Medicaid patients that are part of your patient population. Then we get some reimbursement from them for seeing X number of patients. There are some other metrics. It’s not just the number of patients. There are some other metrics that we have to hit as an institution. As a university system, we get money back. Some of that comes to us in bi-annual distributions. Some of it goes to the organization for programs that are public health-minded, like addiction medicine. It’s funded at that level. I know, we submitted a proposal for med peds service, but that did not get funded this last year. I’m not sure if Marsha’s resubmitting that one or not. It’s that type of thing. That’s the only thing that I have seen where you can get support for a clinical service rather than a more traditional research or QI project or something.",G3
Got it.,"For actual clinical service outside of the hospital. I don't know what exactly their criteria are, so I’m not sure if this would be a strong [crosstalk 30:50].",G3
"Probably not. Opioids makes sense ’cause it’s very much a public—it’s a huge public health problem, obviously.",Peds was not strong enough for it either. I’m not sure that this would—,G3
"I think I know which initiative you’re talking about, a transition of care between peds and adult medicine.",Exactly. Yep.,G3
"Honestly, I could talk with you, literally, all-day long about this stuff ’cause it’s so complicated, and I know so little about it. This was super helpful. I think I’ll probably—as we put together these proposals and try to write up the—understand the billing and stuff and write them up, I’m sure I’ll be coming to you again to help me with it. Thank you so much for your time. This was super helpful, Leah.","Yeah, of course. I will say, for publication purposes, we—’cause we’re going through this right now with the addiction medicine service that Susan is trying to publish on that. Both CU Medicine and Department of Medicine said she could not publish on the specific numbers for clinical revenue collection rate, that kind of thing.",G3
Interesting.,"I think generalizations are okay, but you can’t say that we had a 20 percent collection rate. We’re not allowed to publish that.",G3
Interesting.,Just something to keep in mind. Try and do the right thing.,G3
I’ll loop Susan into it so she can tell me how she ended up handling it.,That just came up this week. I’m not sure if she even knows yet what she’s gonna do.,G3
"Oh, man.","Both CU Medicine and Department of Medicine said, “No, you can’t publish this.”",G3
That’s amazing. That’s really interesting.,"She had specific numbers. She had total charge amount, total collection amount, collection rate. They were just, “Nope. Those types of specifics cannot be published.” They did not give any guidance on what could be published. I think more general information of—we had a collection rate that was comparable to our general collection rate for other types of procedures, or something like that might be okay. You could say whether it was better or worse than other collection rates that you see across your division, maybe. Something more general, but the specifics, they were—",G3
"That’s really good to know. Right now, with implementation science, cost is huge, trying to capture that. People can have a sense of what it costs, and if it’s gonna work in their health system. That’s really interesting that there’s this barrier to disseminating that information.","There’s a little disclosure in the—even just to send you that report, I had—I have access to—it’s called the line-item payment analysis system, or something. I have access to that specific system, but I had to go through additional special training. It was all about what you can disclose [crosstalk 34:00] to the university. We can use the information internally to make decisions on service lines and that kind of thing and different programs that we wanna start or whatever. We can use it internally, but we absolutely cannot share it outside of the university.",G3
You were able to—how did Susan find out? Did she think to ask someone?,"She did. Yeah, she did. She just sent me an email saying, “Hey, I’m writing up a manuscript. I wanna publish this sentence.” I was like, “I don’t think we’re gonna be able to do that, but I’ll check.” I sent it to both CU Medicine and the department and both said, “Absolutely not.”",G3
"Interesting. Well, thanks for the heads up. That’s super interesting.",I wouldn’t spend too much time on the specific numbers because you can’t publish them anyway.,G3
"Okay. [Laughter] Okay, good to know.","We can say that it’s comparable to our general collection rate, something like that, I think, is acceptable.",G3
"What is our budget? What’s our annual budget in terms of how much we collect? This is a tiny, tiny amount.",It is.,G3
It’s really just about covering costs. That’s how you think about it.,"This year, 13,471 is our offset budget from the hospital. For our total, total cost, we’re at 25,200,000.",G3
Geez.,Thirteen million of that is covered by the hospital. The rest is in our professional service fee collection.,G3
I see. I’m gonna let you go. Thank you so much.,"Yeah, no problem.",G3
I’ll be in touch.,"Okay, sounds good.",G3
Bye.,See ya. [Pause 35:40 - 35:46][End of Audio],G3
"Navigate. Okay. Find the right interview guide. All right. We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of implementation of lung ultrasound. You've been asked to be interviewed because you may be affected by POCUS implementation. Interviews will be de-identified, recorded, and transcribed . Do you consent to being interviewed? Deb?",My zoom took a [laughter 00:37].,G2
It's all right.,"- I had to sign in and sign back out, so—",G2
"Oh, okay. Do you want me to start over?",Are you sharing something now?,G2
"No, I had just done a little, a verbal consent. I'll start over. We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of implementation of lung ultrasound. You have been asked to be interviewed because you may be affected by lung ultrasound implementation. Interviews will be de-identified, recorded, and transcribed. Do you consent to being interviewed?",Sure.,G2
"Okay. Please keep in mind that there are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I ask you today. If a question is unclear, please just ask me to clarify. What is your professional title and job description?",I guess you want my admin one.,G2
Yeah.,"I'm a senior medical director for UC health, for clinical documentation integrity.",G2
Okay. Great. Are you just here at [unintelligible 01:44] or what hospitals do you oversee in regard to that?,"Well, I directly work with on a frontline level with the Denver Metro hospitals, but I'm the senior medical director for the system.",G2
"Okay. Can you describe what those responsibilities entail before COVID and maybe after COVID too, just briefly?","Yeah. When I first started doing all this, I was doing utilization management care management and CDI, and of recent in the last few years, I've whittled down to specialize in the CDI piece. I work as basically a liaison between the CDI nurses, coding and clinicians, and provide education, not just on day-to-day specificity of documentation, but also, on how to frame things in such a way that quality metrics are attributed appropriately to our hospital and our clinicians and the service lines. Then I also I work very closely with quality on various initiatives that involve not only documentation, but spill over into the clinical.",G2
"Okay. Oh, I'm talking to the perfect person. That's great. Then with COVID have any of those responsibilities changed? I'm assuming there are a lot of issues around CDI and all that stuff with COVID, but—","Yeah. As you can imagine, the CDI nurses have been pulled every which way that loose, they actually we're doing the CCIs, they were the ones filling out the CCIs. A lot of them got pulled for that as well as for clinical. We've had to step up as the physician advisors and medical directors of CDI and come to escalating things to physicians who are more than direct contact than it had been before. There's some increased responsibility in that setting. A lot of things that we were doing as far as projects ourselves, as well as those with quality and other stakeholders have like everything else a little bit been on the hold and those are starting to creep back in. Then as I was mentioning before, I have been serving as the physician listing, is the official name of what we do here, the PCCS role for the command center It's the physician clinical support supervisor. Like I mentioned, we are the liaison between frontline providers and in our C-suite in the command center.",G2
"Got it. Okay. If that's the case then my next question is, I told you a little bit about lung ultrasound and I'm wondering, how do you make—how do you discuss an intervention like this where you feel like there's gonna be a clinical benefit? How do you make it something that the administrators will invest in and come on board with?","Well, obviously there's a cost savings, that's important, but also before we did this interview, I thought we were talking about just specifically POCUS and specific things with the lungs that we were already doing. The reason that, that was important too, was, is one of the patient's safety indicators through DHHS is Iatrogenic pneumothorax. You can imagine there, well, where in the setting of pneumothorax, the data could be much improved. I would presume from doing direct visualization, thorax and teases, as opposed to doing those blindly. Anything that can show value to patients and improve outcomes obviously is important. Anything that would help the patient's experience. Maybe in this example, they have a bedside study instead of having to go to and fro to radiology, or go for a CTPE that might be avoided and that sort of thing. Really cost value, which probably with inequality a definition of value. Then patient experience, I think are the big ones.",G2
"Oh, great. We know that's all well-documented the literature that patients love POCUS and so it's actually not even something I am collecting data on because it's so well known. How are those metrics acquired and talked about in our hospital in terms of the patient experience?","Yeah. The patient experience specifically part that's under not my umbrella it's really under Patrick's and now it spread out in a different way, but I think before it related a lot to surveys, the data that came back through CMS data, the specific questions that were asked of the patients that sort of thing. Then we would actually—we would compare how we were doing and with patient experience against best in class I'll call, and as well as along in our system a competition across our system to be the best there too, as far as UCH.",G2
Do you feel like that—is that another big driver of  what's invested in?,"Oh, yeah, I think so. I'm jumping ahead, but certainly if that data is already there and clear, that certainly would be in a courtroom to include in a case for this.",G2
Got it. Okay. What else?,"'Cause if you think about it, that's big driver, not only in reputation, but also on value-based purchasing and other things, so—",G2
"Right. I'll just tell you a little bit about the billing data that we've collected. Basically, we're collecting $23 per lung ultrasound and in terms indications for lung ultrasound. It's basically again, there are centers that are using it as for—and the data supports using it as first-line for anyone who is dismic 09:08 or anyone who has any changed decompensation in their respiratory status, and also actually in the emergency room. I'm actually working with the ED to implement among their providers as well. The other piece of it actually, is that this is not unique to hospital medicine. I think we're one of the people that are really pushing for it nationally, but it's also actually in other subspecialties. I think like the people I know involved, certainly the ICU, ED, family medicine, anesthesia, who else? I think even surgery, I got some emails about projects on that service as well. Essentially, there are tons of subspecialists who want this technology and we're all moving toward it. I'm wondering how that helps push things forward? The fact that it's not just like one division, I guess.","Well, I think anything that is far reaching, whether it's far reaching across the hospital or especially if it's something that's far reaching across the system is always an advantage.",G2
What role do you think guidelines and studies play in adoption by administrators in supporting the infrastructure for something like this.,"I think that that doesn't hurt and when you present to whatever group you're gonna present to obviously not going into a huge level of detail, 'cause there will be people probably that aren't necessarily clinical, but getting the salient points across and obviously the broader the audience of the studies the better.",G2
"Based on what I've told you so far, what pitfalls do you potentially see in implementation or from the perspective of your perspective in terms of what you do or some of the other stakeholders that I basically talk to clinicians, I don't really talk to any other administrators. Anything else that you think is a potential pitfall or a facilitator that I should talk about?","Sure. I think the two things that come to mind and I'm not sure exactly where these would fall into those categories, but just things that come to mind is as if we're going to be doing more ultrasounds than study and radiology, radiology is certainly a stakeholder in that. I think we've already gotten a good relationship with, as you mentioned the ICU folks, so that probably is not an issue. They're probably be thankful that those are being done out on the floor as well. Again, the role or lack of role of need for radiology techs to come and help what impact that is. Is that gonna be less work because they're not having to come and do films as much as there's gonna be more work for some reason? What that impact is gonna be? Would be a couple of things I can think of offhand.",G2
"Actually, they're very much on board, which is really interesting. It was actually the—actually one of my radiology—I was thinking about it in heart failure and then it was actually one of my radiology colleagues who we're in the same research training group. He was like, ""Can you please get people to stop ordering chest x-rays with your lung ultrasound?"" That's how that conversation got started in terms of the de-implementation or replacement of chest x-ray with lung ultrasound in terms of my own work. Then I've been able to talk with the chair of chest radiology as well as the head of radiography, and so they actually gave me all of the really compelling financial information about that. The fact that the tax, they were like, if half of the x-rays went away, we would be happy. It wouldn't be we were having to lay people off, or it would be some problem for us at all so—",Are you looking now mostly at UCH?,G2
"Right now, we're looking at UCH, but I think that this is probably the same. Right now, I'm focused on UCH because this is where our pilot study is gonna be going forward, but I think that these principles hold nationally with the exception of maybe the VA.","I just don’t know if [crosstalk 14:26] financial impact that's a little bit different in the private hospitals than might be at the university. If you're thinking of expanding it outside of academia, I would certainly re-engage any of those local folks as well.",G2
"That's a good point. Yeah, and in particularly if they're not doing the really fancy tertiary care center tests, right? Like chest x-rays, maybe something because—","I don't know what that impact would be financially on other or other on radiology, but it would be good to know whether you started doing that or are implementing things I would think.",G2
"Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. Right now, we're just really looking at academic centers. I think the VA is the other place where no one really cares too much about, tuff too much because of their billing set up, but yeah. I think that those are all my big picture questions. Actually, what can you think of another initiative that, or other things that have been taken up by the system successfully, and then some that have, have not and talk about sort of the differences between those so I can learn from successful examples?","Yeah. Gosh. I'm trying to think, because in CDI the focus has been a little bit narrower as far as 'cause a lot of this stuff is more utilization management. You think about maybe analogies would be what of the super expensive, maybe not covered chemos and other high-cost drugs are accepted those kinds of things. I think in that setting, if people say I want a drug because I want a drug that's not very effective, [laughter] but if they can show the data on it to make P&T committee and all the ones involved be supportive. Even if it's not a money maker to show clear at patient benefit and evidence that it will be effective and how we're gonna navigate the payment piece or not payment piece, et cetera. I think that's successful. I think folks historically that have asked for things and said, ""Well, we need this and we want this."" Whether that be asking for more faculty, asking for more toys, asking for a new fancy hip replacement type, that sort of thing that really doesn't fly. I wouldn't expect that you would do that, but it can't be just, I want and I need without some background information.",G2
"Got it. As much as you— Oh, go ahead.","Also, in thinking about the respiratory viral panels and the flu tests and GI and PCRs and when to test for C. Diff and use the toxins or not. All those things apply as well. Its really data driven.",G2
"Then who hears these arguments? How does that work? You have some clinician with an idea, they're getting their arguments and ducks in a row. Then how does it work up the chain to the person who's gonna make the decision?","That's a good question. 'Cause there's been in the last few months, a lot of a fair amount of re-organization of committees, like trying to make sure that they make sense that there's a good reporting structure that there aren't excessive duplicative committees and things like that. I'm thinking to start with the players that historically have been looking at these things are our COO. Then of course, our CMO and if it has a quality related effect, our CQO. There is a CMO/CQO meeting where sometimes things get presented. Then now it's been redesigned I think, that a lot of things were presented at the CEPS committee, the clinical effectiveness patient safety committee, that Jeff had put together. It wouldn't be too hard and unfortunately, I wish I had a better answer for the exact interview for the purposes you said that you're doing it. I don't think it would be hard for me to find out where the best venue would be. I can do that—",G2
That'd be great.,- offline and try to help figure it out that what would be the most effective way to go with it.,G2
"Okay. Thanks. Then, so it sounds like it's basically cost of it, evidence of efficacy and patient experience. Those are the big drivers?","Yes. Of course, if they can do anything to automatic quality metrics, like I said, in the setting of if you wanted to do ultrasound, which you're already doing to do a thoracentesis and it can decrease the number of deems that we get from CNS for having, Iatrogenic pneumathorax, figuring that, that's a benefit.",G2
"Yeah, definitely. Okay. The procedural piece. Where are the quality metrics? Is there a list of those?",I was gonna show you this. I was actually gonna collect some data for you for what turned out to be the wrong thing.,G2
"Oh, you're so sweet.",Where did I have this? I'm trying to find a slide for you that I can share here in just a second.[Pause 20:36-20:40],G2
"Yeah. I know that the Medicare, like the CMS, they publish every year, new reimbursement guidelines. Is that right?","There's a bunch of different things. At CMS there's the hospital readmission reduction program [crosstalk 21:00] there's purchasing program. There's the hospital acquired conditions reduction program. For the hospital acquired condition reduction program within that post-op these patient's safety and or caters lie of which one is the Iatrogenic pneumothorax, and essentially, all of these programs have their own financial effect, but for that one in specific, like if we're in the bottom, I have to look at my slide, but if we're in the bottom core tile of hospitals in regard to having too many of these patient safety indicators, then our entire Medicare reimbursements are decreased by 1 percent, which doesn't sound like a lot if you think about how much Medicare there is out there that's a lot. Then you start adding on other things. There are also value-based purchasing agreements with various payers from time to time. There are things that US news looks at, but sometimes they overlap with [unintelligible 22:11] which is also obviously something that we use to see how well we're doing compared to other academics. The hospital acquired readmission —the hospital acquired condition reduction program; all those things you can see right on hospital compare. It's also a reputational thing for our patients to see. They're in a lot of different places.",G2
It's complex.,What's that?,G2
It sounds very complex.,"It is very complex. I can explain this all day, if you wanted to go to —I think I have a link to the HRQ site and it basically goes through the various patient safety indicators involved with that. Also, I'm just blabbering right now a lot of stuff, but one of the programs in hospital readmission is heart failure readmissions. If we're more competent as to whether or not something is heart failure, we code that correctly, then obviously that can make a difference as opposed to calling something heart failure that's not heart failure.",G2
"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about just the [Crosstalk 23:31] Yeah. Those are some interesting—that's an interesting argument. Yeah. As opposed to them leaving with an undifferentiated dismia diagnosis which may —","Or at even the worse calling it heart failure and it actually wasn't heart failure. Then they come back in because for heart failure, the readmissions are all costs. If I'm admitted with heart failure and then in a week, I get hit by a truck and come in with a femur fracture that counted as a readmission. You wanna make sure that index admission is coded appropriately.",G2
Is it the quality officer for the hospital that is responsible for keeping tabs on all of these different metrics and troubleshooting where there's a problem?,"Yeah. We work on that actually very closely together. I actually do all the reviews for Denver Metro when there's a potential patient safety indicator, and I'm the second level review. The first level review is one of the CDI nurses and they look and see if there are any exclusion. Let's say it's a post-op hemorrhage hematoma, and it turns out that the patient had coagulopathy, but that wasn't documented. That would be an exclusion. They may send out a query for that and get that excluded [crosstalk 24:54]. Then if they can't find anything and it's still there, then I'm the last ditch effort to look for coding opportunities, making sure that diagnoses are valid. For example, post-op sepsis, if you call something post-op sepsis and it really not sepsis, really dang as really badly. I look at all those for our hospitals and then for the hospital acquired conditions, make sure that it's clear whether it was present on admission or something that happens here. Then when those come up, … and I send out a joint notification to let the provider know that one of those has gone through.",G2
Okay. That is so complicated. Then my understanding is that we've always done very well with heart failure. In terms of readmission and that was never something that they were focused on in our particular hospital.,"Again, it depends on what data that you're looking at too, because again, this is way in the leads, but for example, Visiant has various service lines within Visiant and there's the cardiology service line. Then their metrics are based on DRGs that we may be taking care of the patient for. Heart failure looks like it's all cardiology, for example, and it's really cardiology and medicine and family medicine. I guess, it depends on what you're looking at. I think the opportunity, however, more so is in the length of stay metrics, and so if you certainly could make some impact on length of stay by having better diagnostic accuracy, then that would certainly be something.",G2
"Yeah. Yeah. There's actually randomized control trial demonstrating lung ultrasound guided diuresis, can reduce length of stay. Then you can definitely expedite diagnosis, right? If you know on day one, this is heart failure and not COPD like then you don't have to—","[Crosstalk 27:17] something waiting give him the echo the next day, waiting [unintelligible 27:22].",G2
Right. Like he's not responding to the NABS. Let's just give him [unintelligible 27:25] and see if it helps.,"Yeah, and see what happens, exactly. That empiric stuff and not knowing what we're really doing is part of the problem with the metrics. We don't get those diagnoses right. That actually comes to another point too, is there's length of stay data out there that we want those metrics to be where they should be, if anybody knows where length of stay should be, that's a whole separate topic, [laughter] but as it interacts with readmissions and all that stuff, but you want those metrics to bode well, but also as you know our issues with capacity, anything that can show to help with that. Then in the end, like they say also of course, affects money because that bed's being taken up by somebody else.",G2
"Right. It sounds like in POCUS and lung and these other—for instance, like getting the paracentesis done in the ED, as opposed to having them be admitted and then—","Oh, my God."" I hate it when they take off two CCs and they come up with a belly full of varieties.",G2
"Right. Like POCUS has the—in our hands when we're the providers, I think has all sorts of ways to expedite care, which is better for the patient and everybody. One other thing one of the concerns I've experienced with clinicians around POCUS, is that they're concerned that the POCUS is gonna add to the bill for the patient. As you know, I'm not the best hospitals with regard to understanding billing. It sounds, as you can tell me, you can educate me on this. It's a DR—go ahead.","Yeah. Here's the deal. When a patient is hospitalized, we have some contracts that are like percent of charges and that stuff, but then that's majority of those are based on observation reimbursement or inpatient reimbursements. We get paid by a certain DRG, and substantially when, as far as from the hospital standpoint if we do—if we have an OBS patient and we do an echo, an x-ray, and I dunno, I'm just making up exams and all that, we're actually losing money because it's pulling it from that DRG. From this patient standpoint, what they're paying for is part of the professional fee. They're gonna pay a professional fee, whether it is an x-ray or an ultrasound, or fill in the blank for the read on that. If you're substituting one thing for other studies, as opposed to adding studies, then I don't see how that creates an additional cost.",G2
Okay. The patients do get charged something for these diagnostic studies it's like a portion of the professional fee. Is that what you're saying?,"Right. If you take, just—you can't speak too much except for Medicare and maybe Medicaid because everything else is contractually based. That's why people are always using Medicare. It could vary from payer to payer, from hospital to hospital. I'm not privy to all of that, but for example, for Medicare, they would pay 20 percent. Actually, let me see facility diagnosis. Yeah. They would pay 20 percent of the CT interpretation, or the echo interpretation, or the EKG interpretation. I'm looking at this one that's from a long time ago. It would be very interesting to say what those fees would be for those particular things 'cause I'm looking at an example from like 2011 here, and so I'm seeing here that like the CT read is like $44 so 20 percent of that and the echo is like $64 EKGs. They pay 20 percent of that if you put it in perspective, what we charge for are like initial H&P and sub scan notes and all that, they're way more than those.",G2
"They're way more than those. Oh, so you're saying like one more test is not in terms of what they end up paying is not that. You're saying it's a small fraction?","Again, I'm looking at a very old slide. If you had an initial H& P that a nine, nine, two, two three, then that would be $204.22 of which they paid 20 percent, as opposed to a CT interpretation, which is $43.35 and 20 percent of that. If we want to do patients for favors, we would stop putting in profi fees for these patients that are sittin' there and we're not doing anything for 'em. That would be a bigger benefit than actually [laughter].What it would be interesting to say is if we could get the hick picks, which is like the coding for various studies and say, ""Hey, this is what that recharge would be compared to, if somebody would have gotten a CT or they wouldn't have gotten three chest x-rays. Or they would have gotten fill in the blank."" Does that makes sense?",G2
"To be honest, it's very complex. I'm getting a little lost, but I'm just—",Let me see if I can show you—,G2
"No, it's okay. Well, I have one really basic question then we can—'cause I'm realizing I'm gonna definitely need you on my micro costing studies. [Laughter] I'll be bugging you about this.",You'll be what?,G2
"Well, I'm gonna be doing these micro costing studies which basically a way to determine the cost of an intervention where no—that's implemented in a system where no cost data really exists. If that makes sense. They call it micro costing because what something costs is very, to a certain incentive it's contextual. Right?",It's very contextual.,G2
It depends on how much the people involved. They're getting paid. That depends on location. You know what I mean? Like the same test—,"For example, these examples you're talking about, depending on what deductibles are and all that stuff, it would cost a patient way more to get a study as an outpatient than an inpatient.",G2
"Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Right.  Because they're doing—but I just have a basic question for the purposes of this interview and then you're gonna be like trying to educate me on this and being probably frustrated 'cause it's quite complex, but I'm just getting over the hump of like, if a person is hospitalized, even if they have insurance that the insurance pays for what falls under the DRGs, but the patient will always be billed out of pocket for a portion of the professional fees. Is that correct?","Well, in the case of Medicare, again, the thing that gets even more tricky is that in Medicare, we're talking about Medicare part A, as far as doing [unintelligible 35:36] Medicare part B, is what pays a lot of the copays and things like that. For example, if you have a patient that comes in OBS and they have A and B, then B covers the OBS, except for their copay. I'm sending to you right now, this very old slide it is for explanation purposes. Because again, I think this stuff is very complicated. A picture is worth a thousand words.[End of Audio]",G2
"I'm gonna record. Okay. We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of implementation of lung ultrasound. You've been asked to be interviewed because of your role in implementation of lung ultrasound. Interviews will be de-identified, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Do you consent to being interviewed?",I do.,G4
Okay. Can you speak up just a little bit? I'm gonna turn my volume up too. What is your professional title and job description?,"I am a hospice by background, and I have the role of assistant director for quality improvement for the division of hospital medicine. I'm also a physician advisor for the hospital.",G4
Okay. Great. Can you describe your roles as the physician advisor and director of quality?,"As physician advisors, we each have different roles that we play, but my role is specifically around utilization management and care management. In the UM setting, not only do we look at utilization in terms of patient status but we also look at utilization in terms of length of stay and opportunities for improvement in that realm.",G4
Got it.,"That’s more pertinent for this, I think.",G4
Okay. Yeah. Do you also look at utilization of tests and procedures in the hospital or is that someone else that looks at those metrics?,"Technically the supply chain does fall under the purview of the utilization management committee. We will look at biologics and certain high-risk meds and very expensive meds, but we do not look at the basic lab tests and things like that.",G4
"Is there another group that does look at that thing or is that like it's not considered high enough priority in terms of resource management to look at, for instance, chest x-rays and these cheaper tests?","Yeah. By definition, what you're describing is high-value care and so we should be looking at utilization. I bet you [unintelligible 02:27] don’t look at this mostly because it impacts their workflow. It impacts their utilization and reimbursement, things like that. I don't know if it's official—what the official channels are that look at it.",G4
Okay. Okay. Good.,Are looking at it.,G4
"Let's see. Great. That was really helpful. It helps me guide our interview. Can you tell me your experience or knowledge so far with lung ultrasound and point of care ultrasound in general, from a systems perspective and from a clinical perspective as well both?","I'll start with the clinical perspective because I have more experience in that. I've personally used—not personally, but I've personally asked our procedure team to use POCUS to help with diagnosing and infiltrate. Like if I see something on chest x-ray, it doesn't quite fit the clinical scenario. I'll actually reach out to the procedure team to say, ""Do you mind taking a look at it up for me?"" That I can get a better sense of fluid, what does it look like? 	We've done that a handful of times, and it has been very helpful and clinically associating that with a scenario, mostly because I'm using it for scenarios that are like either/ or, and I'm not quite sure. The other experience I have with it is asking the procedure teams for thoracentesis where I know that they do lung ultrasounds I will look at that. I think I've had a couple of times where they'll tell me, look, ""It's too loculated, or it's too small and we can't access it. 	I think it's been very helpful in that regard to get either IR involved or not actually tap anything because it's too small despite the imaging that shows it's moderate. I think in that regard, it's very helpful. From a systems perspective in my quality improvement role, while I haven't used POCUS to drive any improvement efforts, I can see the role for this tool in clinical care and patient safety events, and quality improvement. 	It may obviously make sense if it helps decrease utilization of the less valued imaging. If I can help prevent a chest x-ray, that's always helpful. If I can get more information, that's always helpful. It's gonna help me guide clinical decision making. Obviously, there's gonna be patient safety impacted. To me, it feels like it's a great tool. I think personally, it's something I wanna get better at that I can use at myself rather than rely on somebody else.",G4
"Yeah. Well, that's all music to my ears. I think I'll follow up on that administrative piece of it and some of your thoughts. I guess from my perspective as a clinician who definitely sees the utility of it for many of the reasons that you just talked about but I have less access to the folks that are making decisions about what to invest in terms of infrastructure to support this. 	Can you describe how those decisions are made when a clinician or a group of clinicians comes with a proposal for something that they wanna do, some quality improvement initiative, or innovation? How does that gain support from administrative decision-makers and quality experts?","I think it's variable and that's why it's so hard, school of medicine approaches it one way and specifically the department of medicine. There's the hospital and how they approach care, and what they value in terms of metrics and improvement efforts. There's no one approach that works across the board. What I have seen be successful is people doing robust pilots that show improvement in metrics that the responding administrative group thinks is important. 	For the hospital, it's length of stay, readmissions, early discharges, things that have those impacts. They're much more likely to get funded, to be better supported than folks that are just doing the pilot for the sake of doing a pilot and not having the impact. Having said that the themes to take into account are the infrastructure piece. In this case, you might actually show patient safety improvements, quality improvement.	If you're not sharing any other more financial benefits, like the stay, readmissions things that impact discharge then they're just not gonna get funded to be completely honest, but the infrastructure piece that really matters here is the ultrasound itself and the training. If this is gonna require a ton more investment into the ultrasound machines themselves and training of the faculty and faculty development, then there is that offset the chest x-rays and the CTS and things that we're pursuing that I think that you'd have to think about the cost analysis benefit here. 	I can just imagine …, who's our CFO saying, ""You just asked me to invest $100,000 in this. What is the benefit in terms of beds?"" Yes, patient safety matters to them, and yes, quality improvement matters but I think at the end of the day, it's not the school's responsibility.	From a school of medicine perspective, I have no idea 'cause I'm not really involved in quality improvement in that space. I think they value research and educational mission, but how that fits into the broader support I just don't know to be completely honest.",G4
Okay. Just to give you some background and then you can give me feedback on it. We have randomized control trial—we have a randomized control trial demonstrating reduced length of stay with lung ultrasound-guided or diuresis and heart failure patients. We also have three randomized controlled trials demonstrating that lung ultrasound can keep patients out of the hospital. I guess my question to you is what is a meaningful reduction in length of stay and improvement in readmission?,"I think it's a variable again in terms of who you talk to. My mind, the advocacy I make a point of pointing out is really anything even hours makes a difference in terms of capacity. There's length of stay in terms of length of stay self and how we get reimbursed for it. Then they're length of stay in terms of capacity management where even a few hours, or even like two or three hours can make a huge difference in terms of throughput and in terms of getting a patient out of the ED. 	You have to think about both of those perspectives. When you're putting dollar amounts to that word, I think you have to say, we anticipated length of stay improvement at X hours, here's how that impacts your throughput. Here's how that impacts your overall bed capacity. Here's how that's gonna impact your reimbursement and actually tie dollar amounts to it. Definitely, there's a way to tie the dollar amounts to it. I would just have to get the right people involved, but yes, there is a way to convert that and that's where I think you show it. 	Readmissions, is a different ball game in that, on the one hand, we have paid for readmissions. It's a DRG, we're gonna get reimbursed for it, but we're gonna get dinged in our quality metrics. Right now, the quality metrics really do matter because CMS has put out the value-based purchasing where reimbursement is like 1% ding, which is huge in terms of getting money taken away from our pockets.  	Two is Medicaid hospital transformation program where 30-day readmissions is an actual metric that we're going to get held accountable for, that has dollar amounts tied to it. Now value-based purchasing is happening both for Medicare and Medicaid. I think the Medicare one has been postponed a little bit, but still, it matters. A 30-day readmissions is gonna matter. If you can show that it decreases readmissions that too will matter in terms of the bottom line.",G4
"Okay. Okay. Yeah. It's so complex the things that are taken into account in terms of costs. What is my next question given that— one thing that I wanted to clarify, what is your sense of—I think we're doing pretty well with readmissions in our particular hospital for heart failure. Is that your impression that that's never really been a pain point I don't think for our particular hospital?",I think it has been.,G4
Okay.,"I think it has been. I think there's a core group that's constantly working on it and looking at opportunities for improvement, but I don't the numbers off-hand 'cause I'm not in that space, but I do think there's always room for improvement.",G4
"Okay. Even though we do maybe better than average, it's still a priority. Is that all looked at with the cardiology group 'cause they've taken care of the most of the heart failure. I think we only get about 250 cases a year, which is a very small amount, given the size of our group.","The heart part with the heart failure work is that it's different hospital by hospital. At our hospital, we take care of probably a third to—I think a third of the patients in the hospital medicine group. Then the rest are taken care of by cardiology. When you look at the data, again I have not looked at it in a while, but I believe the issue is that cardiology group that takes care of heart failure, do a better job or are on track for length of stay and do all that. Hospital medicine has improvement opportunities.",G4
"Oh, good. From my perspective [laughter]. Great.",[No Reply],G4
"Yeah. When I look at opportunities for heart failure, from my UN perspective, it's hospital medicine and its family medicine that has the opportunity, not heart failure, but the data is hard to like actually navigate because of that. Yes, I'm able to get the MRI and level data, but I can tell you DHM has opportunities in heart failure for length of stay. I don't know of readmission data off-hand.",[No Reply],G4
"Okay. Good to know. Great. I would love to work on that with you, but going forward, what do you think that the first steps are to that and who is working on that within our group? If we've already identified opportunities, I'm guessing there are folks within our group that are working on that.","No, they're not. As a UN committee what we do is we look at DRGs across that entire hospital, not departmental, but across the hospital. We'll say, ""What are our opportunity days?"" We're [background noise] thoughtfully in that, like, I can't think about outliers because the outlier folks are typically care-management based and not medical decision-based. 	Essentially what we built is a database that says, ""Can I filter my data to say your 30 days or less length of stay?"" When I look at opportunities for improvement in that space at UCH, what are our opportunities? The top three to five are really heart failure for DHL family medicine. Sickle cell for our group, because I liked the length of stay is way off than the national average and mostly because we don't take care of them and we don't have a robust program around it. Then it's like spine and a couple of other folks. 	If you look at the opportunities, we went to [unintelligible 14:58] as our director of quality improvement role. I think we said, ""We cannot take on too much because we have a fairly small quality group. How do we wanna prioritize?"" We prioritize sickle cell. Actually, there's some work happening. I think Sophia Payne was working on this at one point and Ansel was working on it a little bit, looking at some opportunities, but nobody's looking at it robustly. 	To me, when I start thinking about prioritization for UM for next year, this year I did the three improvements. We'll continue to work on that. I have to pick my next three opportunities, heart failures, where I would like to DHL to concentrate on. Yes, that would be huge role for lung ultrasound and thinking through training and opportunities, because I bet you, our care is variable in comparison to heart failure, which I think is much more aggressive.",G4
"Uh-huh. I'm super excited because I can—and we can talk about this after the interview. One thing that I was curious about, so lung ultrasound is actually quite evidence-based at this point, I'm talking about within the last year they've been like multiple randomized controlled trials. They've been looking at BNP for like 15 years. I don't know how many millions of dollars they've spent on that tool, but they haven't shown—we're three for three with lung ultrasound and heart failure at this point in terms of preventing hospitalizations and urgent visits. 	The data is really there. It was actually incorporated into the European heart failure guidelines in 2016, even before this randomized controlled trial data. In fact, I'm working with Juliana in the ED because it's also demonstrated—we have randomized control trial data demonstrating it's more accurate and expedites diagnosis of heart failure in the ED.  	You can imagine if you can start diuretics 100 minutes before you even get the test results back for BNP and chest x-ray and then you're not waiting until day three to start diuretics 'cause they were actually called the COPD exacerbation on presentation. You can imagine what that can potentially do in terms of length of stay and readmissions and so forth. 	The one thing to note is that, so the European community has been adopting it, the European cardiology community. There's a lag in the American cardiology uptake. One of the things that I think hospitals across the country will have to negotiate is this how they're managing their patients and then how cardiology is interacting with this new tool. That they don't really know about yet. I guess my question practically speaking is who do we collaborate with from cardiology with regard to how we're managing our heart failure patients?",Yeah. I heard two things in there. One is what is the role for lung ultrasound in our management for heart failure patients. Two is how do we best collaborate with cardiology to move this forward?,G4
What is their role in our management in our hospital?,"When I think from my perspective at the end of the day, it's all about patient care. When you're thinking about how to move this along in terms of next steps, I think if you've connected it to what is best for my patient and walked it back to what does that mean for us? 	Then I suspect you'll figure out both things, but practically the way—if I was coaching a heart failure program, I think what I would say is let's take a look and understand what are factors that are contributing to long-term stay and readmissions for our heart failures, all of them. 	Let's just list everything and do our root cause analysis, and get a better sense of what that says. I guarantee that part about is variability in practice, either wrong diagnosis upfront, or we're not being aggressive with our diuretics and we're not involving cardiology in the right moments.  	I think based on my previous conversations with … and … who do their GI for cardiology, they want to be involved. It's what is that involvement look like and when is that ideal? I think when you're thinking through the next steps and project wise, in my mind, you could either start collaborating upfront with them to understand factors or build something that you think is interesting and then get their perspective on like a little bit downstream to say, ""We're gonna try this. We'd love to understand what you want to be involved in."" 	I don't think there's either wrong, but I personally think it's always better to get the stakeholders at the table early to say, ""I wanna figure this out. I think there's gonna be benefit. Here's what I'm thinking. What do you think?"" I bet you that there's going to be interest because I know speaking with Karen and Larry, that there's definitely interest in improvement efforts across the board and when hospital medicine is dragging their data to this degree, then absolutely they want to help impact the care.",G4
Okay. I had a question on the tip of my tongue and then I lost it.,Sorry I talk a lot.,G4
"No, no, it's great. I'm actually a terrible interviewer 'cause I have too many questions before people are done answering the last one. what do you that—so you mentioned going back to our data that's the next step, is that what you see is like actually just figuring out what is happening with our patients and then plan from there?","Yeah. This is where it gets tricky for me in particular because I have a hospital role and I have a divisional role. I never know when that ties in because my bandwidth is very small. My assistant director role is not really funded at all if you think about it and so how do I figure that out? The way I've approached it is to really take it to Ananda and put it on her plate. 	What we've hoped to do is build—I think what's happened with sickle cell. I'm hoping to emulate for heart failure, which is build a group that's led by a junior faculty member who's interested and that … and I would coach and mentor across and let them do the work so that they're learning QI. They're getting networking opportunities because they work with people across the board. Then we can coach a mentor without doing the work because we don't have the bandwidth to do that in project-level work, but what's happened,  my tutor leads to sickle cell work and he's been phenomenal 'cause he's such an engaged faculty fellow is he does all the data dive himself. Then we meet with him to review that data with him to understand, ""What does he think? How do we guide him?"" Things like that. Then he brought the group together. Like we tell him, ""Here is the stakeholders, here is whatever,"" but he's doing all the work. 	We built a huge stakeholder group that—it's a working group and it's him, ED, nursing, care management, us, all coming together and family medicine to say, ""Here's our data. What do we wanna focus on? What's our aim statement and how do we gonna actually measure improvement and have worked through that so that now we're focused on building a care pathway for sickle cell that starts in the ED and ends in the clinic?""  	You can imagine what impact that would have in terms of variability. I suspect something very similar to that for heart failure would work amazingly well. If we got DHM, family medicine, cardiology, and nursing together, maybe even care management because of the readmission piece and got us all together and said, ""Let's look at the data, let's do a deeper dive. Let's understand what variables are actually contributing to length of stay and contributing to readmissions, and then prioritize like top three.""	Maybe that's gonna be a care pathway. Maybe that's going to something else. We don't guide what that looks like. We let the group decide. That's how I think it will be most successful getting everybody at the table together. To me, the next step is really figuring out, is there somebody who's interested in taking this on 'cause I suspect—and you probably don't want to be that person I want to be.",G4
"I definitely would wanna. Yeah. Well, we can talk about that, but yeah. I definitely would. We can talk about how that might work, but yeah, so, but I understand the model that you're talking about. That's very helpful for the purposes of this interview and just practically speaking going forward.","If you show impact in length of stay and readmissions at the end of all of this, you can then take that back to any leadership to say, ""I decrease our length of stay by a day and a half on average."" That is a cost savings of X, Y per patient. I want to take that and invested in something similar, but do it at a broader level. That's how you show impact. 	For the care management piece, I don't know if you knew this. I think you know this. When I started here, care management was by unit. I had to talk to six care managers because there are six different units that patients were at and I hated it. I went to leadership and I said, ""Find me a care management time and I will show you impact."" 	When we showed a decrease in length of stay by half a day, the CMO for the system or I guess she's now the CMO for the system, like, ""Yeah, let's do it."" Now it's care management at UM service-based but you have to show what that looks like. It's helpful to have I think leaders right now who understand that this is important. I suspect that you will make an improvement and then you take that back to them and say, ""Here's how we're gonna reinvest and grow.""",G4
Okay. Great.,Then you go capital with them.,G4
"That's amazing. I'm gonna hopefully follow up on some of these comments, like as soon as we're done with the interview, but one last question for the interview. What role do you think pathways play in potentially introducing POCUS as a quality innovation and in general, how do they usually—how are they developed and utilized in their effectiveness?","I think care pathways is an interesting opportunity to really streamline care meaning, remove the variability of practice and really build evidence-based care in one place. We've done a very good job of that. There's a pathways committee, they do multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations to build that evidence, make sure they're taking all the perspectives, things like that and then building it.	I think, where we've not done a very good job with our division and … know this because I've shared this perspective is that we've not translated that to use. We've not actually taken the time to build culture around pathways so that all these amazing pathways are getting built and we're just not using them. Until that happens, I just don't think pathways is going to be part of our routine care because we have not built that culture. Having said that I do think that there is utility for them. I think that it is a great opportunity to embed POCUS especially because it's evidence-based into care. I think that if you were to streamline, ease of use there, and build culture on using the pathways, you would get a lot of bang for your buck.",G4
Okay. Great.,I think it's something to think about the question is who takes responsibility for using that pathway?,G4
"Yeah. What is the process, how long does it usually take to develop these pathways and then put into practice? I'm guessing like COVID was probably the fastest one that was ever created and implemented, but generally, what is that process look like in terms of timeline, stakeholders, versions?","I'm gonna speak in generalities because I'm not part of the pathways team, so I don't know how long it takes, but my general sense is if you said, ""Here's the pathway I'm thinking about. Here's what I put on paper,"" and actually worked with Sarah to build it out, the building it is not hard. It's built then getting consensus on it that I think just takes longer, but it depends on how you do it is my thought here.	Now that I've been building some for the department of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery and things like that, generally what we've done is we've just gotten everybody at the table after we built an outline to say, ""Let's just talk through all the pros and cons,"" and it takes forever. I think it's different because they don't know about pathways like DHM does. My sense is that it builds fairly quickly and as long as you know who the right people are to ask to come to the table, it'll go fairly fast.",G4
"In terms of building culture around it, what do you think would be involved in that? Because I actually think, it's all relative. It's a spectrum. 'Cause to me, I'm like, ""Oh, I think people do use them."" That my perspective, but what do you think, what additional steps do you think would need to be taken for them to be truly utilized and make an impact?","Yeah, I think you're asking me fairly tough question that I don't know how to answer off-hand. Having said that, I think there are few things that we've not done well on pathways. One is this burning platform. Like we've not actually talked about why do pathways and not order sets or usual care. What am I doing wrong that you wanna help me improve and that burning platform has not been built? 	I think COVID has taught us one thing, which is that burning platforms are key. We all came together around this virus that has really impacted patient care. We came around that concept of patient safety, like no other time I've seen before, and we've not done that for pathways. I think building that burning platform and figuring out how to connect that to a patient's story. I think will be key in helping people understand, like why should I use this pathway and not my heart failure order set and thinking through that.	Then ease of use, so that if you build all of the things that's going to help a patient safety and patient care, and quality improvement all of that, then I think that will help. I think the burning platform has to be first and foremost. Think about it, when's the last time you talked about a care pathway?",G4
"Oh yeah. I'm not ever user at all. You're saying like for heart failure as an example, you show folks our metrics and what that impact means for the health system and the patient in terms of evidence-based care and all of these things that we talked about: patient safety, keeping folks out of the hospital once they're discharged, and then you start with that and then you show them how the pathway can help them achieve everyone's goal of like best possible care.","I would say you need to be even more raw than the metrics. I think something along the lines of—I'm just going into big, big generalities here, but hospital medicine is hurting heart failure patients in comparison to cardiology. You're in the hospital for two days more, that means you're higher risk for falling. You're higher risk for other nosocomial complications, all of that. We are harming our patients by not providing good care. 	I think it has to be at that raw level for people to come around. Data, I think helps paint a picture, but people don't connect to it the way that you connect to something raw like that. I'm not saying that that's what you need to use, but I think you need to think about what is that thing that makes people be like, ""Oh shit, I'm sorry. I need to do better.""",G4
Emotion. Yeah. Evoke the emotion. Yeah.,"I think that we don't do a good job at burning platforms and emotion, and maybe that's a patient story. Maybe that's something that's really raw. Like what I just shared, but something emotional that ties us to that.  That says, I need to use a pathway or I need to do X, Y, and Z because I'm gonna hurt my patient otherwise. I think that's what we connect to having done numerous QR projects. That's what I'm learning is I, if you don't connect it to that emotion, we're just not gonna get the buy-in.",G4
"Okay. That's great. That's just great information. Thank you so much, … I'm gonna actually turn off the recorders.[End of Audio]",[No Reply],G4
"We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of lung ultrasound implementation. You've been asked to be interviewed because of your role in lung ultrasound implementation. Interviews will be de-identified, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Do you consent to being [laughter] interviewed? Sorry.",Yes.,G5
Okay. What is your professional title and job description? I'm interested in both your role as a clinician and also your role as the pathway leader in our group.,"Okay. Clinically, I am like 97.5 percent clinical [laughter]. I work mainly on oncology and then some med two. Then I do a little bit of HMS and swing.",G5
"Oh. You're on med two with the proceduralist. Very cool. Okay. Tell me a little bit about how you got involved in pathways and just that evolution in interest and what you've learned about it so far. 'Cause, that's something I'm really curious about.","Yeah. For pathways, I just joined the pathways committee, which started immediately when I joined the group, … was looking for people to be a part of it. I had an attending in residency who did a lot of clinical pathway stuff and he was one of my mentors. I learned a little bit from him. Then I just became like a nun to his little assistant for a couple of years. Then when she got promoted to the quality and safety position, she gave me the clinical pathway director position. 	What I do with it now, and it's been—I guess it was last summer, it was like June ish, 2019 that I started being the director. I'm just in charge of curating all the pathways, maintaining them, making sure that they're up to date. Then I do pretty much all of the pathway authorship. If people have pathways that they wanna build, they come to us and we give them guidance on how to build it and then they build it. 	Depending on how their first draft looks, …and I will look at it. If it looks good, we'll have our pathway committee look at it and have them weigh in. It's got a lot of hospitalists and then pharmacy, nursing, and that's pretty much it. Then like some data people, so Angela's usually there too. We decide what changes we need to make and then once the committee approves the pathway, I usually just author it in agile. 	The biggest barrier I think right now is getting the orders integrated because it involves a lot of Epic support, which we don't really have. John Pell helps us with some of it, but he's obviously very busy and then Rob Harrison is also really busy with other pathway stuff. That's probably our biggest barrier to getting things and the fact that I have to do it all and I'm 97.5 percent clinical [laughter], so.",G5
"Yeah. Some bandwidth, limitations there I would say. How do you guys choose which pathways to develop? Clearly in two, given the bandwidth issues that are always the case with us, how do you choose which ones you wanna develop, and then how long does that usually take that process?","When we first started building pathways, we started out and we actually just made all the antimicrobial stewardship pathways into agile pathways 'cause those already existed and people were already using them. That was pretty easy. Then we've just been updating those as they go along. We honestly just had a bunch of brainstorming meetings where we listed things that we wanted to make pathways for. 	Then people talked about which ones they liked. We like to choose ones that are usable obviously so that we see a lot of patients with a certain type of diagnosis. We also like ones where we can look at outcomes to see if pathway usage is influencing any type of outcomes. That's probably been the hardest part right now. Now that pathways have been live for about three years. We have enough data I think that we're starting to look at outcomes for individual pathways and for pathways overall.",G5
Very cool. That's where the data—I was wondering what the data folks were doing on the committee and so that's what they're doing. They're trying to link it to the EMR. Okay. Got it.,"Yeah. Angela essentially just does like data warehouse queries for us. Then she gets all of the data from Agile as well regarding pathway usage, so she can link those.",G5
"Do you have a pathway that you're like, this is like a successful pathway and we've considered a successful pathway for these reasons, or is it a little too early, to call anyone pathway success? Although maybe COVID, I don't know.","I think we can say some of them are successful in the fact that they are used frequently, but until we have the outcomes data, I don't think that we can say that they're 100 percent successful. That’s what we're working on right now. ALTO has been a really popular pathway and has made a big difference in a lot of people's practice that was Caitlin's pathway for alternatives to opioids. The COVID pathway was successful in the fact that the system liked it, so they took it. [Laughter]",G5
"Good. When you say successful, people are using it, and then have you seen that practice there's less variability in provider prescriptions or management even if you're not quite at the point where you can actually look at outcomes,",That's what we're looking at still right now. Even those types of process metrics. Yeah.,G5
"Got it. Can you tell me about the evolution of—and it sounds like it's still in process of the heart failure pathway, and then also how do you incorporate the subspecialty stakeholders? Like I could imagine that there could be some territory things where it's the hospitalist patient, but the subspecialist thinks that we should be doing it a different way and maybe we don't agree or—but it sounds like there's actually been some really great collaborations where the subspecialists have actually just adopted something that your group has created. Can you talk to me a little bit about that?","Typically, with subspecialty, it's either a pathway that we decided that should be made and so we made it and then reached out to them to get their input, whether they thought that there were things that we should add. For the CHF pathway, that was actually Sophia, who wanted a project essentially and because her husband's a cardiologist and she knows cardiologists and works closely with them, she thought that would be a good one. 	It's been in process for probably a couple years, just 'cause there were multiple prior versions of it where it just wasn't making sense. This is the most coherent version that we have right now, although we still have a lot of questions for it. The other subspecialty type pathways, like the troponin pathway, the cardiology service came to us and said, ""We wanna develop a pathway so that we can help your providers figure out how to manage elevated troponin and we don't get as many consults essentially.""  		Then the other piece with the troponin one, that was really big that we don't have for a lot of pathways, but I think the heart failure one would have a component of it as well as the documentation piece.  Deb Anoff 08:47 is also on the committee and she helps us with that. Making sure that we're documenting everything correctly in terms of billing and all that stuff, so.",G5
Okay. Super interesting. It doesn't sound like you guys have had—you've been working well with the subspecialists then for the most part it's very collaborative.,"Yeah. I think sometimes when we make random pathways and we try to reach out to people, they're like, ""What do you want me to do?"" Now that pathways are becoming a little bit more ubiquitous, they understand, and we can usually find somebody who can help us. 	That was a big part of… being part of the pathway, just 'cause she's been around for a while. She knew a lot of people. She'd worked on projects with other subspecialists before in the past. It was a good connection. That's something that I'm slowly developing to working with all these pathways and developing those connections too.",G5
It's mostly likely the biggest issue is just getting the subspecialists engaged enough to give you their expert input on what we should be doing. Got it. Okay.,"Exactly. We make all of our pathways based on guidelines and the literature. Then a lot of it especially the antimicrobial stewardship ones are based on institutional guidelines 'cause the antibiogram is very specific. There's a lot of pathways like the lumbar puncture pathway is very institution-specific 'cause that one is talking about how you arrange a lumbar puncture and that stuff. It's nice to get them to weigh in both as an expert in their field and as someone who works within our institution to say, ""This is how we do it here essentially.""",G5
"Got it. Okay. Cool. For the pneumonia, and the C-Diff like in terms of ID, so you guys went to—well, it sounds like—so how did that collaboration work? 'Cause, it sounds like they're working with you in pneumonia, but then they also basically liked what you did with C-Diff, can you talk about that process?","They essentially, as part of their antimicrobial stewardship guide, the little book that they used to print, they had a bunch of pathways and so we just asked them like, ""Is it okay if we take these pathways and put them into Agile form?"" They were fine with that. We did that for those, and then they didn't have a C-Diff pathway, and so we just said, ""Can we make one, and then you guys can review it?""  	I just made one with Koosh 11:10 and then Matt Miller reviewed it and just tweaked it. It was also when they were trying to—it was when we were switching from like Flagyl bank to Vancomycin. It was an opportune time for them to get some new guidelines out for our providers. That also is pretty institution-specific 'cause it's not exactly what the IDSA guidelines are.",G5
"Yeah. How often do you update them since there's constant changes in practice? Is this something that you revisit on a regular interval or is it just like, ""Oh, there's new IDSA guidelines out? Let's just revisit this and make sure we don't need to make changes.""","Yeah. Each pathway has a pathway author and for the antimicrobial stewardship ones, I'm on the antimicrobial stewardship committee. I get all of the updates for whenever they're changing their practice so I can easily incorporate those.  For all the other ones they're in charge of reaching out to me if they have any changes. 	Otherwise, I reach out to everybody on an annual basis to make them review it and make sure that there's nothing new. For the high sensitivity troponin, they just reached out to me. They have to take it upon themselves and then if we notice anything, we'll definitely reach out to them. At least every year I make sure that they review it and make sure everything's still up to date.",G5
"In terms of the evidence, how important are evidence when you're making these pathways? For the large majority of what we do there isn't any evidence to guide us and it's—a lot of times what sounds like, and what I would imagine is that you're like, well, what makes sense in our institutions since we don't really have any high-quality data or data that really applies to our setting, like, how important is that with regard to these guidelines or these pathways? Sorry.","Yeah. We just have a hierarchy of evidence that we use. We use national guidelines for a lot of things where it's not clear what to do, like a lot of anticoagulation stuff or dealing with coagulopathy, there's not a lot of national guidelines, but there are a lot of institutional guidelines. We'll usually try to stick to those, and then if there's nothing based on guidelines, either nationally or institutionally, then we just use the highest quality evidence that we have.  	Sometimes subspecialists disagree with the national guidelines too. Like for the C-Diff management, if they're able to provide high-quality evidence, then we're usually okay with trying something out. I think for them too, some people like to use pathways as a little bit of an experiment just to see if we can get people to do it this way, then maybe we could get some evidence that this might actually be better. That's one thing that might be better for like lung ultrasound where there may not be evidence for everything.",G5
"Yeah. Yeah. As evidence goes, we have pretty good evidence actually at this point. It's all relative. It's so interesting. For instance, what did they disagree with the IDSA guidelines about for C-Diff?","They recommended using Fidaxomicin and as first-line in somebody who had a recurrent episode that had already Vancomycin whereas the national guidelines said that you could do a taper or use Fidaxomicin, but they felt pretty strongly about using Fidaxomicin based on a Lancet paper. It was literally just one piece of high-quality evidence that they had that made them suggest that. That was just like an example.",G5
"Cool. Okay. Oh, that's super interesting. For the anticoagulation stuff, I'm just curious, do you have a hematologist that helps you with that? Because it's true the data's all over the place and it's moved so quickly because of all the new products or how do you guys do that? That sounds logistically challenging unless you have an expert who's engaged.","Yeah. It depends on the pathway. There's an anticoagulation steering committee. For example, we're making a COVID pathway right now and they're helping to determine what the DVT prophylaxis should be for them and that's completely made up. There's no guideline for that at all. It's just the committee consensus essentially.",G5
Got it. Okay. Yeah. That's nice that we do have some like nice pharmacy infrastructure that can help you with some of that stuff. Okay. What do you find the most challenging about the pathway work?,"One, I think getting people to use it we've struggled with, so like for example, Angela is looking at this ALTO data right now of the sample of patients that Caitilin was looking at, who qualified for, ALTO use. The number of people who actually use the pathway was very, very small. It's hard to see actual changes if we can't see whether or not people are using it. I think that's been a huge challenge. 	Then just hurting all the stakeholders as well can be a little bit challenging. We have a fairly good relationship with the ED. They have a very robust pathway program. They also have a lot of resources that we don't have. They're actually running the systems pathway but it's usually pretty easy to link up with them and get help from them and see what they've done before. That's been really helpful.",G5
You work a lot with Matt Salzer 17:11?,"With Matt and then Shawn, Michael. We don't like work directly 'cause our pathways are in different realms, but like if I have questions or if—a lot of times when subspecialists are building pathways, they also want to do stuff in the emergency department that doesn't necessarily apply to inpatients. I can help link them up with that as well.",G5
Got it.,"They can also just serve as a really good model for us. Like we built our instructions for building a pathway off of what they use and our expectations for pathways off of what they use. It's just like a much better-established program that they have. It's been nice and they've had a lot of success with people using it. It's challenging 'cause their pathways tend to be more symptom-based and ours are more diagnosis-based. If someone has an unclear diagnosis, then our pathways aren't always as useful because if you don't have the right diagnosis, then you probably aren't gonna be managing it right.",G5
[Laughter] Yeah. It's the hard part of our job for sure. I don't know if you've been trying to engage or are aware of the movement with pathways nationally. Like what do you see happening with pathways across hospitals and hospital medicine? Or do you have a sense of that?,"Yeah. We have. We've connected a little bit with other people who use Agile. Johns Hopkins uses that and so we've connected a little bit with them and then honestly, most of the like big academic hospital systems we're still using like paper pathways. Even Children's who has a really robust collection of pathways are just now getting them into Agile. 	I think a lot of people are finding the technology to be challenging in terms of switching over from when they just had paper guidelines that you could find online to now trying to integrate that into the EMR. That's been a little bit of another challenge too, is like, what makes a good pathway, and what makes something that should be a pathway? 	'Cause a lot of things could just be an order set. The big thing that makes the difference between a pathway and an order set is when you need clinical decision support so that you can help someone decide what to order and what to do versus the order set where they just click through all this stuff.",G5
"Right. I'm trying to decide which question to ask next. I have a couple; you talk about getting people to use it. Do you mean like getting people to view it or like actually translating that into like the orders they place? Because one of the questions I had for you is have you guys—and maybe it's a bandwidth issue. Have you been trying to think about doing prompts through the EMR? Like nudges through the EMR with regard to orders, like for the opioid stuff, for instance.","Yeah. I would be happy even if someone looks at it if they don't use the order. The order is just there to help their workflow if they think it would be helpful. Sometimes what we do is be like put little Easter eggs within the pathway, like the diclofenac gel was only available to the ALTO pathway and so that was like people had to go in there to use it. In general, we don't really care whether they're just looking at it to use it or if they're using the orders. 	In terms of the Epic prompts, it's really difficult to get Epic to change anything. For the longest time, we were just trying to change the button so that people like the tab would come up more easily. That's actually been one of the really good things about the COVID pathway is now people actually know where to find pathways. Whereas before some people were like, ""I don't even know where they are. I don't know they exist. It's not my workflow."" Getting like BPAs and that stuff through Epic is pretty difficult.",G5
"Yeah. It sounds like a lot of people—so I have a colleague who's actually—it sounds like a lot of people are trying to learn how to just build stuff in themselves. Is that like, I don't know anything about that, but that's partly [laughter] why I'm like asking you, but it sounds like we have these programs now where the clinicians can learn to build, probably to solve some of these issues that you're talking about. 	Like waiting on a technician or an Epic person for like three months to change one thing when I actually need 20 things changed and I need it done dynamically and iteratively. Like that's just not something that will work. Is that something that's happening? Is that like if you found a junior faculty member who wanted to learn about informatics and could do that for you, is that like a—are those options a possibility for somebody who had the motivation?","Yeah. There was an Epic builder course and ..all actually took it. They're gonna be able to do what John Pell does now, but then you need a system, Epic person to implement it and that's where the real bottleneck is.",G5
Got it.,"That's not something that just like a normal provider can train in.  If you're gonna make—we have free win with the pathways and it's almost like we were grandfathered into it 'cause I don't know if we did it now, if they would let us do it the way that we're doing it 'cause we can pretty much do whatever we want and they don't govern it at all but if you're gonna make any changes in terms of like a BPA or an order prompt or anything like that, then you would need system-level approval, which takes a million years. 	That's why like the COVID pathway right now we have zero control over. … is on a committee and she can give her opinion. Even when we give our opinions, they don't really make changes 'cause everything happens so slowly and everyone's so busy.",G5
Got it.,We developed an entire new discharge pathway because the one that's in there is totally out of date and I gave that to them in November and it's still the same one that's up [laughter].,G5
"Yeah. It sounds like they need a support staff person. Then the strategy would then be demonstrate that you can increase efficiency or improve outcomes, so they give you like, basically hire another person to help you implement this. Would that then be the strategy?","I think the biggest problem with that is that they're trying to make a lot of pathways system-wide right now. They're using their resources to do that and not really giving us resources just as a hospital medicine group. It was like when Jen Weiler took over, she started wanting to make all of these pathways system-wide. Like all the antimicrobial stewardship pathways, they started writing them again and Agile and I had to tell them, like, ""We already have these, you can just use them. You don't have to rewrite the whole thing.""	I don't think they would give us any more support definitely at the system level. I don't think Maricia 24:30—I think it would have to be somebody like volunteering essentially. I don't think there's a lot of incentive for them to do that just in our division. Especially we're working ourselves out of a job a little bit just 'cause the system is adopting a lot of our pathways and then when they do, we no longer really have any use over them. It's good that they're adopting them, but it's just means that we have a little bit less control and it's much less nimble when they do it in terms of making changes and new pathways and stuff.",G5
"Interesting. Do you think that like the—I guess get getting back to like my other question is, do you think that like where hospital systems are moving toward pathways 'cause of this desire to reduce variability in practice? Is this something that we're gonna be seeing more and more, and more and more is gonna be invested in?","Based on what we've seen over the past few years and the push from the system to do that, I think, yes. I think there's still a lot of pushback from providers because they don't want it to be like cookie-cutter medicine and it is sometimes hard to fit your patient into these molds. In the ED, they always say pathways should work for about 80 percent of patients. Then there's gonna be 20 percent of cases that you're gonna have to use your clinical judgment and this won't apply to, but I think the system is [unintelligible 26:06] as a prescriptive thing. 	Especially with COVID just because nobody knew what they were doing. It was easier to tell somebody, just do this 'cause they were like, ""I don't know, so fine,"" but somebody who's been treating pneumonia or C-Diff or pain for decades, isn't necessarily gonna wanna use a pathway to change the practice.",G5
"Do you think that's a big barrier in our group? We've got a younger group I think.  Hospital meds, in general, tends to be skew younger.","We've done surveys to ask people why they don't use pathways or if [unintelligible 26:44] and a lot of people said, ""I just don't remember, or it's not part of my workflow."" Then there are a good number of people who are like, ""I need the pathway, I already know what to do. I'm happy to use it.""",G5
"Yeah. Have they shown that pathways can reduce—like in other institutions, I know you're working toward that here, but have there been a number of institutions at this point that can demonstrate increased efficiency and or improved outcomes with pathway use? Okay.","Yeah. There's a lot of papers just from like specific tiny pathways. Like in transplant medicine, there's a lot of pathways that people use and they've been studies that shown that that helped. Then there was a big pathway paper that came out of Seattle that was a pediatric hospital and they had a ton of pathways and showed actual outcomes like data in terms of length of the stay and readmission data, even for pathways usage. 	There definitely have been ones that have shown it. It just depends too, 'cause there can be good pathways and bad pathways. If somebody has a pathway it's not implemented right. Or it's just a pathway, then it's not gonna help them. Sometimes it's hard to pick what's a good pathway and what's a bad pathway.",G5
Got it.,Yeah.,G5
"I guess coming back to the heart failure pathway, you mentioned that it's been in process for a few years, was it in process even prior to Sophia focusing on it?","Not that I know of. … was in charge at that point, so I didn't really become involved with it until Sophia sent me another version in the Spring. Then we tweaked it a little bit and got … input. A lot of that was also just like putting institutional expectations in, in terms of who takes care of which patients. Then trying to standardize the care of heart failure patients on the hospital medicine services.",G5
"Right. I'm just curious, what was cardiology's perspective besides yeah—even in terms of the triaging questions, like what was cardiology's perspective on the way the hospital should be taking care of heart failure?","Being in general, we already have had these conversations a lot, like … I've had these conversations with them.  It's pretty well established I think in terms of who should be taking care of which patients. Honestly, a lot of the heart failure patients that we get on medicine we have because they have other complicated medical issues and it's not just the heart failure. They have hemolytic uremic syndrome and renal failure and everything. 		In general, the other thing that I find a little bit difficult is you'll talk to one subspecialist and they'll recommend something. Then when we try to implement it, the other subspecialists will be like, ""What are you doing?"" That happened to us with COVID. The critical care people told us, ""Consult us for anybody who's on six liters or more of oxygen."" Then people were doing that. The people they were consulting were like, ""Why are you calling me?"" The communication on their end is a little bit different and it tends to be to the people we talk to tend to be a lot more conservative and wanna be called a lot more. I wonder if they're higher up and less clinical and the more clinical people are like, ""I don't need to see these patients.""",G5
"Yeah. We don't have the resources actually to see all of these people. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds it. Did you find that with cardiology as well, or not really?","That they've been struggling with cardiology for a long time, but they've actually worked really hard. Now it's really clearly defined who deserves a cardiology consult and at least clinically like anecdotally I found when I'm on service that they're very responsive and very helpful. They are just like—I don't know if they hired more people or something. 'Cause I do feel like bandwidth has gotten better.",G5
Good. Yeah.,They're so slammed that they didn't have time to do anything 'cause [unintelligible 30:54] had their own service and we're doing the consults and it was just—,G5
"Yeah. I got that sense too. Okay. Great. Do you have any thoughts? [Laughter] I was really actually interested in the whole pathway view 'cause I don't know anything about them, but they seem like a very interesting tool to help implement new things or standardized care, which I'm interested in both with regard to heart failure patients. I think there's a lot of opportunities for hospitalists across the country to do that. 	It sounds like there's opportunities even in our own hospital and our own division. What are some of the pitfalls of the pathway? Beyond what you were saying about like some patients don't fit into the flow diagram that the pathway offers, any other pitfalls or problems you see in broad implementation of pathways?","I think sometimes it can become over-complicated and that definitely was happening with the [unintelligible 32:11] pathway. We tried to simplify it. It's still a little messy, especially in the bottom. Like there's a lot of loops and stuff. People get lost. I would say making them usable and making them actually something that could help somebody's workflow instead of make their life harder. 	'Cause if we can make it something that both makes their life easier and can help us by standardizing care and, or getting people to use something more frequently like lung ultrasound, then I think we can do it, but it's just you have to make it usable and you have to make things that people understand and not just be bogged down by and feel like it's another thing that they have to do.",G5
Right. Okay. Great. I'm trying to think if there's any other questions I have for you right now. I think that's it. I'm gonna turn off the recorder.[End of Audio],[No Reply],G5
"- interview so I can let you get onto your—I’m sure—next Zoom appointment after this. We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of lung ultrasound implementation. You’ve been asked to be interviewed because of your potential role in lung ultrasound implementation. Interviews will be deidentified, recorded, and transcribed and analyzed. Do you consent to being interviewed?",Yes.,G6
Can you tell me your current and prior professional titles and job descriptions?,"I’m an internist by training, practiced as a hospitalist, formerly founded and ran the division of hospital medicine at a VA for 3 years and then at the university for 12 years and started and continued to direct the Institute for Healthcare, Quality, Safety, and Efficiency, which was founded in 2012 to provide quality and safety development and training on the Anschutz campus for children’s hospital at the university hospital school of medicine college of nursing and in that capacity served as associate dean for clinical affairs for quality and safety education and then was chief quality officer at university hospital for five years and for the UC health system for three years before stepping down form those roles in July. My current title is associate dean for quality and safety education and director of the Institute for Healthcare, Quality, Safety, and Efficiency at Anschutz.",G6
Can you tell me a little bit about your experience with lung ultrasound or maybe POCUS in general and from both a clinical and a systems perspective as a leader in hospital medicine?,"Clinically I have no experience so do not train in it, do not practice it. In terms of professional experience I was involved as a board member of Society of Hospital Medicine for 10 years, and during that time we spent a lotta time talking about POCUS and how we would deal with questions around competency and certification as well as training and was part of the board that put together some of the training for ultrasound so played a limited role in that capacity at a society level. I think the first time I was involved at the university hospital was probably five or six years ago, which I think was a decision to purchase I think it was the first ultrasound—I don’t know how many we have now—on the floor. There, I think, had been one in the ICU and I think there was in the ED, but there was not for the wards, and we were always going to beg and steal. Those and that decision came out of a safety event that happened, again, probably six or seven years ago where a patient had a pneumothorax, and one of the identified issues is that we didn’t have ultrasound available. Those are my involvements to date.",G6
What do you see as the current barriers as far as you know and future barrier—I guess I’ll step back and say do you think that it’s likely point-of-care ultrasound will become standard of care in the care of hospitalized patients besides just procedures?,Are you saying for diagnostic?,G6
"Diagnostics, yeah, ’cause it already is the standard of care for procedures.","[Distorted audio 03:59] It seems like it already is. I think it will be. I think it’s going to be another tool that we use along with other physical exam skills. That’s the way I see it happening, and I think it’s gonna probably take—and you’re a big part of this—it’s gonna take probably 10 years to wash people like me out of the system and bring in new people who are trained through residency hopefully to do that kinda work.",G6
"You see it happening, that all happening, as a generational thing that they’ll get it through training, and then they’ll practice it. What do you think about the folks that are mid-career or maybe early career now, what do you think about them?","What do you mean, about people mid-career?",G6
"In terms of adoption, what do you see happening with that? What barriers for clinicians who do wanna get trained who are already out of training, what barriers do you see to them using it?","Yeah, I think the barriers are probably numerous. One, you made an assumption that people want to be trained, and my strong suspicion is most people in my demographic probably don’t want to be trained. I think a lot do, and when I say “most,” I don’t mean 90 percent. I mean maybe 30, 40 percent don’t want to be trained and largely because it’s new. I think I’m of the generation, and I’m 52, so I’m of the generation where technology is starting to play a big role in our lives, but I remember life before the internet. I think we’re that generation that’s on the cusp so I think some people don’t necessarily want to embrace new technology. I think that’s a barrier. Two, I think people who haven’t seen it may be skeptical of its benefits and say, “Well, how is this better than what we currently use?” Three, there’s huge training issues and credentialing issues around this because to my knowledge—and I may be wrong in this—I don’t know that there are standards out there for diagnostics so that. I think there’s gonna be a cost issue. Who’s gonna pay for this? Physicians, shockingly, despite how much money we make, like to complain about a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars here and there and always feel like someone else should pay for it, [laughter] usually the hospitals, who, I think, would say, “That’s a professional responsibility on your part.” Again, we sorta mentioned the credentialing. I think there’s always the—it’s a little bit less in the diagnostic side but maybe the food fight about, “Those are my diagnostic procedures,” although I think that’s gonna be less than on the therapeutic side. I think those are probably the big barriers.",G6
"Those are definitely the—that’s from the perspective of the clinician. We have more data coming back, that it improves patient outcomes, and it can increase efficiency. What do you think it would take for the system to want to adopt it and to invest a certain amount of energy and money into an infrastructure that supported clinician use?",What do you mean when you say “system?”,G6
I mean the hospital and then health system more broadly so like Anschutz versus UCH.,Do you mean our hospital and health system specifically?,G6
Yes.,"What would be the barriers to adoption? I think that when it comes to this kinda thing, health system and hospital leaders feel like this is purely a clinical decision, and rightly or wrongly, I think, both of those entities do a pretty good job of staying out of clinicians’ business and saying, “That is your determination of whether that’s the right thing to do.” For all of the things that I could be critical about our health system—which, I don’t mean to sound critical. I’m not—I think they do a nice job of letting providers practice medicine. I don’t think that they would necessarily drive anything around requiring credentialing for this or requiring people to do it, in large part ’cause I don’t think they understand if it’s important or not. They do recognize that clinicians need to be clinicians and make those kinda decisions, and then I think they would bristle at the idea that they would have to pay for people to be trained to do this, especially at the university hospital. I think in the health system as well. I think university hospital would say, “Wow, that sounds like education. The dean does education. The dean should pay for this.” I think at the health system they would say, “This is too complicated because we have three or four different sets of providers. We’ve got those who are employed—yeah, they’re probably our responsibility—we’ve got those who are not employed, and then we’ve got the folks who are tied to the school of medicine.” Because there’s those three different groups, I think they would just say, “It’s easier if we just say ‘hands off’ and let you guys deal with this.” I do think that they would be willing to pay for some of the infrastructure around this, but if we’re talking about everybody having a few hundred dollar ultrasound in their pocket, I think they would not pay for that. They would not support that. [Extraneous conversation 09:38]What would it take for them to support those kinds of things? I think you would have to show the typical value equation kinda stuff. Number one, does it provide higher quality care? That’s gonna be tougher to show at a hospital or system level, and hospitals generally aren’t moved very much by [unintelligible 10:04] literature so they’re gonna wanna say, “How will this improve the quality of the care for our patients?” number one. Number two is I think you could make the safety claim, which is the cousin of quality, that this is safer for our patients. Honestly, my experience is if you wanna get anything done in hospitals, you have to go after the efficiency piece. Can you show that this is more efficient for the health system and will increase productivity? If you can show that—and I would say to a lesser but important degree provider satisfaction, but it’s gonna come down to, I think, productivity and what’s the return on investment of this?",G6
What role does patient satisfaction play in that equation?,"Important but hard to measure. I can’t imagine that there’s gonna be a study out there that shows on a macro level patients are more satisfied in a place that does this versus doesn’t. Now on an individual level you could say, “How did you feel about that examination versus that one that didn’t use ultrasound?” You might find people are satisfied, but are you gonna impact things that health system leaders care about when they talk about patient experience is really two things. They care about their rankings so probably reported patient experience scores, and then they care about the brand. I suppose you could make a case that you could market this as, “We are technologically innovative in a way that other health systems are not.” That might be an appeal, but like everything, that appeal will get you a certain amount of investment, and it may not be the investment you need for this overall. Does that make sense?",G6
"Yep, totally.","I think something that is free that possibly makes patients happy, they would be all for it. Something that costs $10 million that might make patients satisfied, I doubt you’re gonna see that happen.",G6
"There is papers demonstrating that patients like POCUS, and that’s pretty easy to—that’s a very easy thing to see when you start using it. Do you think it’s actually worth going after a pilot in your own hospital asking patients how they felt about point-of-care by their clinicians or is that like—unless they actually can measure it in the patient satisfaction ratings that are posted nationally, it’s not gonna matter? Is that something worth going after?",What would be the endgame of that? Why would [distorted audio 12:46] that?,G6
"It would be to convince basically the C-suite to invest in some infrastructure, that this is something that their patients value.",Do you have an amount of infrastructure that you’re talkin’ about?,G6
"Right now our ask is basically this middle ware that would help us train people more rigorously. You probably were around for these discussions. The other thing too is that these discussions have been ongoing for, it sounds like a good almost a decade in terms of how to implement point-of-care ultrasound ’cause the ED has done it, and it’s standard of care for critical care for instance. One of the pieces is having software that will allow you to evaluate training exams prior to them being uploaded to PAX. Right now things are directly uploaded to PAX. From an education perspective, from a patient, as someone who’s supervising this stuff, that’s problematic, I think. That’s one of our asks among the POCUS educators in the hospital. We have all of these trainees. Everybody needs training, but we don’t have the appropriate software to really quality assess those images. That ends up being about $100,000 over 5 years for hospital medicine. It’s not a huge amount of money. That’s one of the asks. In terms of infrastructure that’s what we would want from them. The machines themselves are so cheap at this point, that that is becoming less and less of a concern. It’s this robust infrastructure for really good quality assessment that I think is gonna be needed for us to really do this well. Because for instance right now Juliana Wilson who’s the person in the emergency room who’s responsible for quality assessing the POCUS exams, it takes her like—because of the way things are set up, she can review 10 exams in an hour just because it’s not streamlined appropriately ’cause we don’t have the right software.","The ED also would need this, or is this just hospital medicine?",G6
"That’s the other part of the equation. I definitely want it for my folks, but the idea is that there’s six or seven subspecialties that are trying to implement at this point in the hospital. Yes, it’d be about $100,000 for 1 department, but then if it’s a little bit more for each additional division. We’re not talking about a lotta money. Particularly when we’re looking we’re starting to see literature that demonstrates that it does increase efficiency. It expedites accurate diagnoses. It’s more accurate than chest X-rays, which we know are a low-value test. We’re seeing in other parts of the country where clinicians are foregoing chest X-ray for lung ultrasound, and you can actually reduce the use of other tests. There’s a lot of other data coming out that demonstrated if you do invest in this you can change practice patterns and increase efficiency.","Can you draw the line between the software you’re asking and that outcome ’cause you’re basically saying—I think you’re saying that if you had this software you could train more people more effectively, more efficiently, and then they would produce different outcomes?",G6
"Yes, exactly, and so the big thing with point-of-care is that it’s operator dependent, and while to be a point-of-care application, it needs by definition to be easily mastered, it does take some training. It takes someone looking over time and making sure that people’s skills are maintained, and so that’s the idea is that you can’t really adequately train folks if you don’t have this kind of robust infrastructure for training and quality assessment.","Who would you be training, hospitalists or residents?",G6
Hospitalists primarily.,Not residents?,G6
"I’m focused on faculty development because I just don’t think education has really ever had the—unless you have faculty who can supervise people on the floors in a real clinical situation, the residents will never really attain mastery. You can’t really have a robust training program without some faculty who have also mastered it. That’s why I switched gears and have been focusing on faculty. Although I agree there are a lot of barriers to that.","You’re saying it’s roughly 20,000 a year to train and develop a hospitalist workforce to be able to do this, and then presumably down the line they would also be training people?",G6
"Yeah, for the hospital. Then we do make—we’ve started collecting billing data. There’s like a cau—I think the financial arguments, there we—for a chest X-ray, I guess they reimburse $2? They actually lose $30 per chest X-ray in the hospital, and that data was actually collected by radiography because it’s actually radiology who feels like it’s a low-value test, and they were actually the ones who heard about lung ultrasound. They were like, “Do you think you could reduce chest X-rays by clinicians by—” Everyone’s on board with this idea, that it might be a good idea. If lung ultrasound is more accurate, that we could replace some of those chest X-rays with lung ultrasound. Then the reimbursement, just like the professional fees, it’s not a lotta money, but it’s still a better—still financially you end up positive. We collect $23 for every lung ultrasound, which isn’t a lot, but if you think about the number of—when we’re getting them, it’s basically anytime somebody decompensates. The idea is that this would be first-line imaging because it’s better for basically the most common reasons we get chest X-rays, which is pleural effusion, consolidation, pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax. Anyway, I think the cost and the efficiency arguments are there. I think the trick is getting enough people using it well enough and often enough that you would be able to measure those benefits.","Were you saying that every X-ray in the hospital we lose $30, and the professional fee, though, must be lost to radiology, but they probably are more happy to read something else—",G6
Exactly.,"- over time. Then on the hospitalist side, you’re saying we get paid 20 bucks every time we do one?",G6
Yeah.,"If I do the math on 20,000 a year you need to come up with about 650 of those, not that X-ray, done ultrasound, to get 20,000 a year. How many would you do in a year? Let’s say maybe not year 1 but year 5?",G6
"Yeah, and that depends on adoption.","You’re selling this as a thing that’s gonna do that. If you had three to five years to train the workforce, how many would you create?",G6
"I would say we would be doing—I think it would be very easy to get to 10 a day. [Crosstalk 21:14] Maybe they wouldn’t all forego—I think 10 a day would be a reasonable guess, but I’ll have to look at those numbers and really look at the number of chest X-rays we’re getting a day and then look and see.","If you’re billing at $23 per, is that reimbursed, or that’s billed?",G6
That’s collected.,"If you’re collecting $23 per, and you do 10 a day, that’s 3000. That’s 60,000 a year. If I wanna play hospital administrator, I’ll say, “Wait, why would I pay you for that? You’re gonna make money on the reimbursement.” To which you would say, “Yes, but it’s gonna take us a while to get there.” I think if I were making this case if I were you, I would make it on an efficiency case, I would make it on an experience case, and I would say, “Look, I don’t need five years of funding. I need three years of funding, at which time we will be self-sufficient.” To me it’s not a hard case to make. Would I do a lot of work to prove that? Not for 60 to 100K personally. Is there a study out there that shows anything around reduction and use of X-ray?",G6
"Yeah, all of it. There’s length-of-stay data. There’s decreased imaging, like chest X-ray and actually echo and CT.",What reduction in X-ray and ultrasound do you see?,G6
"The magnitude of effect, I’d have to look. Then I also have quality of data from other hospitalists, and I could probably get their actual data that they’re foregoing chest X-rays. They don’t order chest X-rays for their patients anymore because they just use lung ultrasound.",Have you made this case or not?,G6
Yeah.,What have you stumbled upon? Why is it not [crosstalk 23:19],G6
"Yeah, everything is in—I haven’t actually made it to the right stakeholders, I guess. I’m just building the case right now. That’s part of what this is is understanding the case that needs to be made and what those stakeholders, the people who are actually making decisions, how they make decisions so I come with the right data and the right arguments.","Is this interview for your benefit, or is this for a study?",G6
"This is for a study, but it’s practical.",[Distorted audio 23:50] if you want I can share with you what we teach in the institute on how to make a business case for this. This is a pretty easy business case.,G6
"Okay, that’d be great.","I don’t have published data that there’s no reason to think wouldn’t be adopted here. I’d be happy offline to shoot you that talk I give and walk you through it if you want, and then I can help you put together the business case, but this is pretty simple. It’s 100 grand. Do you know what the health system’s budget is or revenue per year?",G6
"The health system’s? It’s just Anschutz. You would know better than I. I don’t know. [Laughter] It’s a lot more than 100,000.","Yeah, a university hospital is probably 1.5 billion [crosstalk 24:38] 4 to 5 billion so 100,000 is nothing. Now every person comes with 100,000 and says it’s nothing, and over time those 100,000’s become billions, but if you can actually show the data that we can do this and say, “Look, hold us accountable. We will look at X-ray per patient—” or however you mention it, X-ray per 100 patients, whatever it is—""and we think we can do this over 3 years.” It’s a pretty easy business case.",G6
I would love that. That would be fantastic. I don’t even know who I’m supposed to make that case to. I guess that’s the other question. I guess … would figure that out.,"Because if you think about it, what’s the benefit to the school? Well, to the practice plan, you’ll generate revenue. Okay, but the practice plan writ large is gonna lose revenue on the radiology side so I think you could spin that as a negative. It’s not education. You’re not talking about training residents and all that so it’s not a [unintelligible 26:29] issue. It really does come under clinical practice so I would start with Jean. Do you know Jean?",G6
"Not really, but this is all help—if it’s easier for you I could just attend one of your lectures so you don’t have to—I know as an educator I get kind of—it’s exhausting telling people the same thing all the time. [Laughter] I’m happy to just show up to one of your lectures and go from there so you don’t have to—",I only give it once a year and have already done it. Let me try to find it and send it to you.,G6
"Okay, cool, that’s great. I have one more question before I let you go though. Everything is aligned with this is something that should—they should support this. I think it’s an easy sell from a rational perspective, but it’s giving them the information in the way that they’ll be able to hear it. The other thing to is this is an inevitable thing. They’ve been talking about doing this for 10 years, and I think everybody accepts that this is gonna be standard of care. I guess the other piece of this is—how big a piece is that? Do you wanna be leading this, or do you wanna be a lagger? It took a complication to get the first ultrasound. Do we wanna be in that position in another 10 years when all the other hospitals have already implemented this? How compelling is that to them? It seems like it should","Yeah, exactly.",G6
How compelling is that to them? It seems like it should be clear that this is something that they have to do at some point.,"I think so. I think that’s value-add though. Those kinda cases don’t get you very far because it’s corporate America, and it’s about the bottom line so you’re better off—you can use that, but you gotta have the other piece, that this will save money and improve efficiency and length of stay and all of those things. Again, you’re not gonna get any pushback. Nobody’s going to say, “You shouldn’t do this.” They’re just gonna say, “We’re not gonna pay for it.”",G6
We’re not gonna support it. Which is something. That’s good that they’re not worried about getting sued or something and so then they’re gonna squash things.,"The CEO of the hospital, for example, would say, “Look, I’m a business per—I don’t know. You guys decide if this is standard of care. If you tell me it’s standard of care, it’s standard of care. You should do it. Oh, you want me to pay for it? Well, now that’s a different story. Why would I pay for it?” “Well, here it is.” Now you could argue it’s standard of care, but it still doesn’t mean the hospital should pay for it. I think if you were in private practice doing this as a hospitalist group, who would pay for it?",G6
Unless it’s an infrastructure issue so that’s why—,[Distorted audio 29:39] the software?,G6
"Yeah because we can’t [crosstalk 29:43] really—go ahead, sorry.",Can you repurchase the software?,G6
"We could directly, yeah. In theory we could.","If you were a private practice hospitalist group you would have to do this yourself. You can still ask the hospital, and they might pay for it, but they may say, “Look, this is a—I don’t pay for your stethoscope, do I? No so this is your deal. You pay for it.” I think if you’ve got those other papers that make the case it’s pretty simple.",G6
"That’s super helpful. I wanna be respectful of your time. I promised 30 minutes, but if you can send the slides over that would be amazing.","Yeah, I’ll try to find them and send them. I’m happy to jump on another call, walk through it with you. This is what I do. This is what I wanted to do is how you make these business cases because as physicians we’re typically bad at it. The same thing goes for administrators. They’re typically bad at understanding clinical medicine, and so the really, really effective physician leaders are those that can bridge that and can speak both languages. That’s why I like to teach it and spend time on it because it’s actually not that hard, it turns out. I’m being recorded so I won’t say it, but physicians are pretty smart. We just haven’t been trained [crosstalk 31:02]",G6
We’re distracted so we don’t understand how the infrastructure is changing the way we practice and how to interact with that environment so we can take better care of our patients.,The other thing I would ask is is your time supported to do this?,G6
"I basically ended up getting a K so I could do this, and then I have some support from my division. I have 75 percent bought out by the NIH to do this, and that’s what it takes. That’s why I’m able to have the bandwidth to have these conversations with someone like you who actually has a skillset that I can impact practice.",[Distorted audio 31:52] supporting you.,G6
"Pardon, sorry?",Is the division supporting you for your—,G6
"The division, I don’t have—hm-mmm, no other support.",Your funding is all through your K?,G6
"I have some divisional buyout, and then I have—the majority of my buyout is through my K. It’s an implementation in dissemination science. Then this is my content focus.",How much division buyout of your time?,G6
20.,"20 percent? Salary plus benefits this is the other thing that I would bring into it is to say, “Look, we’re definitely gonna support this. Mauretia has agreed to support $40,000 a year of my salary plus benefits. We’re asking for half of that from you, 20 grand.” It’s just the art of this—is you’re bringing in like, “The division is sponsoring this. We’re just asking you to sponsor your part of it as opposed to givin’ us money.” “Is this all the hospital ever sees from us is this, ‘Please give me money?’” If you say, “We’re already supporting this—40K or whatever 20 percent of your salary benefits is—and we’re just asking 20K from you.”",G6
This is that important. We are spending our own money.,"Even if it’s only based on a true story, you’re gonna probably get the funding either way, but I think it is part of the cost of the program, and the division is supporting that.",G6
"In general these arguments for this project will hold for the next, and as you’re saying, I think we as clinicians need to get better at understanding the language.","It’s not hard. I give another talk on how to negotiate, and I say, “The key to success in negotiation is to never ask for what you want. It’s always to ask for what the other person wants.” You say, “Well, that’s weird.” Think about it. If you know what the hospital wants, and you ask for that, why wouldn’t they give you what you want? You just have to not ask for what you want but ask for what they want, which is efficiency, less cost. That’s what they want. If you come and say, “Hey, I got this great idea. It’s gonna save you half a million dollars a year.” You’re not asking for what you want. You’re asking for what they want, and then you say, “To do that I’m gonna need an investment of $25,000 a year” as opposed to coming and just saying, “Hey, I need 100K for 5 years.” Now you’re asking for what you need. Don’t ask for what you need. Ask for what they need. They need $500,000 a year in less costs. We can talk about it.",G6
When do you give the classes? Is it in the fall?,"Well, I give this talk as part of our year-long training program, and I give it usually early on in the summer, summer and fall.",G6
"I tried to get into my co’s fellowship, which I’m guessing your—the program is like what you’re—the stuff you’re teaching, but he was like, “Oh yeah, you’re overqualified. You can’t.” I’d love to sit in if there’s an opportunity, but we can talk about that later.","Alright, well, I will send you—I will send you those slides, and then I’m happy to sit down and either go through it with you, or if you wanna take a crack at putting the case together [crosstalk 35:15]",G6

…interview that then somehow doesn't get recorded.,"You can hear me well enough, right?",G7
"I can hear you perfectly, yeah. Perfect. Sometimes if the connection gets bad, we'll just turn off our video, but so far, so good. Okay, we're interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of _____ ultrasound implementation. You've been asked to be interviewed because of your role in POCUS implementation. Interviews will be deidentified, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Do you consent to being interviewed?",Yes.,G7
What is your professional title and job description?,"I am Associate Professor of Clinical Practice in the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and I am currently the president of the medical staff.",G7
Oh great. Congratulations. I guess congratulations.,It's feeling a little [unintelligible 00:59].,G7
"Yeah. Okay, no, just kidding. What is your prior and current experience with POCUS?","As a trained obstetrician and gynecologist and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, part of my daily focus is in ultrasound imaging. Not only do I perform it in a diagnostic radiology unit for scheduled patient visits, we actually use it for our clinical visits and our obstetric triage process on labor and delivery, so performed within outpatient clinical setting as well as inpatient evaluation and management.",G7
Got it. Can you tell me how long that's been part of the training requirements for OB?,"Oh goodness. I'm probably not the best person. My entire training involved ultrasound imaging, so 20 years.",G7
"Twenty-plus years, potentially.","Easily, yeah.",G7
Talk about early adopters. You guys were the earliest.,"We couldn't have existed, I think, without some level of ultrasound training and skill set for medical students, residents, fellows, and physicians.",G7
"Tell me about your recent role as chairing the point of care ultrasound task force for the hospital. I think my first question around that is, when they asked you to do this, what was your understanding of what the purpose of sort of this bit – it was kind of a big undertaking. What was the purpose of it? What was driving that?","From a system standpoint, for credentialing of privileges, the hospital has several different floors that go out to the different departments, and beyond sort of their basic components are procedural components that providers can elect that they are skilled in and are requesting privileges for. What has been found is that each department's form for ultrasound privileges doesn't always look the same for the process, and there had been not a well-established guideline for how many scans is deemed competent in the emergency room versus what is being done in the ICU versus what is being done in outpatient sports medicine. For the variety of different modalities and areas that providers were using ultrasound to guide their clinical medical decision-making, there had not been a formality to that process. It was more I have this skill, or I believe I have this skill, and I am competent to do this as a part of my assessment, and it's going to add to my clinical abilities.To more formalize that process, we needed to bring together really a variety of specialties and subspecialities who utilize ultrasound on a regular basis in not only the inpatient setting, but the outpatient setting, to come to some understanding that to agree that there is competency when we perform this skill and we are utilizing the resource appropriately. Then beyond that, when we utilize that resource, that (1) we take care that that information ends up in patients' medical records in the appropriate manner in ways that are (1) medically safe for the patient, but also notes that the provider utilizes skill as part of their diagnostic ability, and we have images that can be reviewed as the resource part of that. I think that's sort of the general overview.",G7
"Great. I'm gonna stop my video just 'cause you were – let's go ahead and stop our videos 'cause the connection was a little bit choppy there. I wanna get everything you're saying. Okay, great. You know what's interesting, and you may not have the conversation even prior to that, but some systems are actually not credentialing their providers. It's kind of like this is a big debate within POCUS. Is it just sort of something that you say is part of their clinical skill set? They may not be archiving. Do you know what the conversations around that were for our particular health system?","I can't speak on any of the leadership above me, have they had any separate or private conversations. When I was tasked to chair this POCUS committee, it was because there was a clear understanding that ultrasound was a separate and distinct tool set or procedural skill set that people were—or providers were utilizing, but some with the best of intentions and others perhaps maybe in a way that didn't speak to their clinical skill set. There was a strong desire to make a more uniform process of that and to respect ultrasound diagnostic skills as a higher level of training beyond what they may have experienced or had skills for in their residency and medical training because in some residency training programs, ultrasound is an integrated part of that, and they will come out with a competent skill set.However, when we look back at providers who maybe entered training programs before ultrasound was really part of that skill set or providers are being innovative or on the cutting edge and are learning new skill sets to sort of broaden their scope of practice, what deemed those experiences as being competent to provide that as a diagnostic resource, and I don't think there's a good handle on that. Even by having this credential process, I'm not sure we have a clear understanding of every [break in audio 08:02] skill set, but I think this was a first initial step is to say we believe that this is a diagnostic ability that [break in audio 08:11] to have [break in audio 08:13] for, you have to have a certain high expectation of quality and skill set to do it.I think there are several future steps that have to be undertaken, which is why out committee not only took on the level of we believe that this is the requirement of number of exams that you must provide. Some have to have some level of pathology in them, but we also believe that beyond that, there has to be a quality program in place so that we can continue our ongoing medical education and provider training, even if it becomes archival in quality as those meeting guidelines, so that we are safely utilizing the tool in the future.",G7
"It sounds to me like it's really—it was a quality assurance sort of endeavor, that there's this modality we wanna make sure that it's being used appropriately, that people are competent and then that there are safeguards in place, essentially.",Correct.,G7
Tell me a little bit about your experience chairing the committee. What are some of your observations with regard to POCUS implementation?,"I think the first thing that struck me is I had a basic understanding of how people or providers were utilizing it in the emergency room. That was very easy to understand for their sort of quick-focused assessments of abdominal trauma, recognizing was a pregnancy viable or not, and utilizing some basic functions. But then I really was quite impressed with really the scope of ultrasound utility: sports medicine, rheumatologists, nephrologists, the critical care assessment at the bedside in the ICU, things that I don't do by my personal training but really did not have a broad understanding of how frequent and how often ultrasound was adding to the clinical assessment. I think that was probably one of the more important things for me.I think it was also, because there were so many specialties involved in the creation of this sorta guiding set of documents was making sure that everybody's voice was heard and that we came to really a compromise of we want the best quality. We don't wanna aim for the lowest number of imaging skills to say that you have enough to be credentialed for this. I think everybody had these high standards that they believed in, some more than others, but then we looked at documents that were established outside of subspecialties so that we were just using that and gave people a broader range of skills that could reach beyond just what family medicine is doing or just what the emergency room is doing, what the cardiologists are doing with echo, because there is quite a bit of bleed across the fields in some ways where people need to be trained to have certain types of skill sets. Even if they're utilizing it to say yes, no, yes you need further evaluation, no you don't need an evaluation, this is where it stops.",G7
How many subspecialities were involved in the creation of those guidelines? Can you name them?,"We had folks from cardiology. We had folks who were providing critical care anesthesia. We had family medicine, including sports medicine. We had the emergency room. We had the chair of credentials, Dr. Meacham, involved. We had myself, who was providing input from the obstetrical side. It was important because we didn't have providers who were solely hospital based. Medicine was involved, obviously. We didn't have providers who were just hospital based inpatient units, but we also had providers who were really outpatient and in that setting because they are distinct and different utility for that. Nephrology was involved. Trying to think, am I missing any of the subspecialties? We tried to make sure that we had a broad scope and that people had representation so that when the final document came about, the voices were heard.",G7
"To my knowledge, I don't think some of these outpatient folks are using it a ton yet, but is the anticipation that they would be doing it more, or I guess how did you chose those particular stakeholders? 'Cause it seems like, honestly, literally everyone is gonna be moving toward this technology because it's just better than the bedside tools that we've had traditionally. How did you guys choose those initial stakeholders, and it sounds like there were a lot.","It was really focused on where there was already some level of use organizationally as well as what is being done across United States, for example, sports medicine and rheumatology was invited, but actually I don't think they participated on a very frequent basis because we knew that they were evaluating joint spaces and utilizing the tool for that, for needle-guided procedures. Family medicine, much like obstetrics, cares for patients during pregnancy or evaluates women across the scope of their reproductive careers for gynecologic exams, so we needed to make sure we had certain modalities and certain utilities of use for ultrasound, whether it be transabdominal approach, transvaginal approach, needle-guided procedures. We needed to make sure we had people who could speak to those skill sets, and really their level of training and their comfort with those skill sets because it would have been unfair to consider this only as an inpatient document because that's not how the procedure is being performed uniquely.",G7
"What was the impetus for sort of reconvening this task force? This is sort of this issue of credentialing for POCUS has been an ongoing conversation I think dating back to before I got here in 2016. I think the initial document was—the ultrasound credentialing document was created, I don't know, early-2000-teens. What was the impetus for sort of revisiting this topic?","My understanding or sort of the push to have me reconvene this was that there had been multiple attempts to get some level of ownership within each of the different divisions and departments where (1) people felt that they were represented in the document, and (2) that we were moving forward with a document that detailed our level of experience and desire for quality. My understanding is that a consensus had never quite been reached, so the document had never had serious undertakings that had gone back to the credentialing committee and then the medical board, then finally, the medical staff for approval. It just never could reach the threshold where there was enough agreement that modifications were put in place. It sounded as though projects had been started and then unfortunately failed to meet the mark and then never moved forward.",G7
"Got it. Got it. It was basically just bringing it over the finishing line of sort of a policy that there was consensus on. I wasn't sure, like I know that that document that took your sweat and blood to kind of get in shape, has that been approved? 'Cause the last time I saw the credentialing document, it looked like it hadn't been updated, based on the changes that that task force—where is the document at this point in the policy?","It did take quite some time, I think. We as a group meeting met for over a year, and then it took two trials to get through credentialing.",G7
"Oh really? Okay, that's interesting.","It took two trials to get through the medical board before it could go to the medical staff, and so only this fall was it recently approved. Part of the reason for that is there was a separate desire that once this recommendation for privileges and credentialing of providers in point-of-care ultrasound, we wanted to make sure there was a quality structure, and that only went to the medical staff in January for approval to create a subcommittee, which is really a quality subcommittee that will then report up to CEPS, which is the clinical effectiveness committees that Dr. Wyler chairs.",G7
"Okay. Sorry, so it went to the medical board and then went to the—and then just recently went to the medical staff. Is that what you're saying?","Correct. The quality part. Once the board had approved the privileging, that document now can be moved forward and be utilized for privileging, but the additional document which created a bylaws change because all of our organizational structure is within the bylaws document, and so we had to request an amendment to the bylaws. That required a couple of times to get through to create this POCUS quality subcommittee that presents to CEPS.",G7
Got it. That was the addition that—,That group has not even been formalized yet.,G7
"Okay, so quite an undertaking. You're saying that the reason it didn't go through is that the medical board wanted this—they're like you need to add in the creation of this quality committee.",They wanted some additional line items to be a part of that quality program.,G7
Okay. They basically came back to you with specific additions or things that the stakeholders hadn't kinda come up with on their own.,"Yeah, just some of it was language change, which was quite simple, and then others was to increase some of the sort of the focus of that—the duties of that group.",G7
"Got it. Going forward, when you think about now you know all of these different applications of ultrasound and all the different subspecialties involved, and the fact that most specialties really don't—they're not coming out of their training with these skills, right. A lotta folks are either picking them up as faculty because it's just the technology's so new. What do you think this is gonna look like going forward? You've given a ton of work to it, but what do you think is really needed to ensure sort of the quality that we're striving for as an institution?","That's a good question. In an ideal world, frankly, what I see is someone comes into the role of really the POCUS champion or the POCUS chair who sorta has some level of governance over that quality committee and helps understand sort of proctorship abilities, understands electronic medical records, understands archival storage of images, understands how to set up quality review processes for ultrasound utilization, and then even more importantly is involved in some of the decision-making for really supply chain because, as you are very aware, these machines can be as much as a transducer hooked up to a cell phone.The technology is so rapidly evolving and changing, which makes it a little bit of a device incognito. People can put them in their pockets, they can utilize them at the bedside, they may not have stored images, but they are making clinical judgments based on that without really the ability for providers to share that information very well, and that makes it a little bit of a dangerous tool to me because evaluating quality means you can evaluate all of the information that went into making that patient care decision, and if images were obtained, they should be evaluated and they should be able to be critiqued for their quality and be able to utilize resources within the hospital system for really upping the management of the patient care. If there's a concern in a bedside image, what is the next best step?It's really training folks to understand that to utilize resources that are well trained as well, so radiology has a stakeholder involved. They were involved in some of this as well, and that's always gonna be sort of our fail-safe mechanism. These are people who have been medically trained, are boarded to provide that excellent level of skill set so that we utilize all the tools appropriate. For me, it would be setting in an organizational structure with someone who is dedicated to that process organizationally and then has a handle on really how it's being utilized within the hospital system with folks that are champions in each of those fields who will report back the utility and the quality metrics that they are using, not that they have to be defined by one set of standards, because they may be different for each of the different areas. That way, we say that we understand that this is a diagnostic tool, but a tool that can provide a great deal of information if we're sharing the resource.",G7
"I wanna be respectful of your time, but just a couple of additional sort of more pointed questions. Do you think, from the system perspective, that the—and who asked you to chair this committee? Was it one of the C-suite? Who had charged you with this?","… knowledge of the prior road of POCUS and knew that it had never quite passed the finish line. They also knew that I was from the Department of OB-GYN, using POCUS on a very frequent basis, so they thought perhaps having somebody who had sorta used the tool intimately may have a better opportunity of gathering consensus, is my feeling.",G7
"Got it. They saw this need and they thought you were the appropriate person given, obviously, how important this is to OB. That totally makes sense. I guess, do you think that they were worried about malpractice? Do you think that's one of the reasons that they've really tried to kinda focus on this?","No, I don't. I think it was more to drive just some very basic organizational kind of things. If you provide imaging, you provide a report and an image. I think they wanted to make sure that ultrasound wasn't being used haphazardly for clinical diagnostic purposes, and that we as a community of faculty had the highest level of quality. I don't think malpractice was ever—those words never came up in any of the conversations I had. It was more what drives quality. How do we assure that people are utilizing the tool correctly and not tinkering with a diagnostic procedural skill without clear understanding? I think there are many steps that are ongoing because what we've done is we've done something on a faculty side, but this has to cross and meet the hospital side as well, so there has to be some collaboration and communication with our nursing resources as well because this comes down to the very basic things that we do.What is the life of the machine? What does each individual machine on each different unit, what are its utilities and how does it function, because not all machines are created equally? Does it have the ability to store and download images into a PAC system? Who maintains each of the transducers, the quality, the level of maintenance and biomedical support for the machine? Who is doing all of that? Who owns that machine on the floor? Is it the nurses' responsibility to make sure those transducers, particularly the invasive transducers, like a transvaginal transducer, are they getting into the Trophon appropriately? What are all of those processes because that has huge bearing on patient safety because it's an infection control item, because it's being used patient to patient to patient. What are the infection control issues?I think that's what this POCUS committee needs to drive forward. I personally am going to step back from that. I think it should be owned by somebody who can dedicate really a great deal of time because there are so many areas of interest here, but there are some basic organizational things that need to be met and dealt with.",G7
Is the hospital sort of perspective like that's wonderful to hear that it's really driven by just the desire for high-quality care and making sure this tool is being used optimally within the health system because I'm sure they have other priorities and they could kind of not necessarily put attention to this. Do you think that they want to move toward investing in infrastructure and training in order to—and quality assurance and so forth? What do they want to invest in order to help ensure quality? 'Cause it seems like they have been investing.,"I don't have an assessment of that. Everybody wants something to be done, but they also want it to be done inexpensively and to save resources, but time is a resource. To me, you put somebody who has the knowledge and the skill set, time has to be dedicated toward that, and time costs. I can't answer those questions, honestly. I've not been involved in those higher-level discussions. To me, I feel like we have to get the basic components down, and then the chair of that POCUS group can really move those processes forward and state this is what we need, this is how much time it's gonna take, this is the potential cost to underwrite this type of a quality measure. Those are skills that are beyond my skill set, frankly.",G7
"Any other thoughts about—how long is this gonna evolve, do you think?",I thought it was only gonna take us six months of meetings.[Laughter],G7
"Yeah. I wanna be respectful of your time, so I'm gonna go ahead and stop recording. [End of Audio]",[No Reply],G7
"Okay. Great. We are interviewing stakeholders to understand the determinants of implementation of lung ultrasound. You have been asked to be interviewed because of your role in lung ultrasound implementation. Interviews will be de-identified, recorded and transcribed, analyzed. Do you consent to being interviewed?",Yes.,G1
Great. What is your professional title and job description?,Yep. I'm a hospitalist and division head of hospital medicine.,G1
Okay. What is your role in lung ultrasound implementation and point of care ultrasound implementation?,"Yeah. Well, it's always funny to answer these questions[Laughter] it's to support our directors of ultrasound in their implementation. Then I personally find value in it both as a clinician and then as a leader. I think I have like over, gosh, 15 years, sadly experiences in attending and I've seen that increasing importance of it, I guess. I think my role is to hopefully help support those efforts, support our people and ultimately, I think our patients is to witness in the end so—",G1
What external factors impact your decision to invest in POCUS as a leader?,External factors like beyond the university or?,G1
"Yeah, beyond university, like what's happening nationally that influences your decision to invest in this endeavor?","Yeah, it's a well-known national trend. I think folks that we have here obviously on the front end of that. I think there's definitely a national push, there's more ultra-sound talk now than ever. I remember when I first started as an attending it really wasn't a thing, not at least at Denver Health where I first worked. People would do it a little bit and then I think increasingly there were certain leaders who wanted to start to advocate for us such that you can feel that there's a movement of sorts to implement ultrasound I think in the hospital's world, there's certainly more papers. I think we have an advantage because of the research we do. You know what I think? My dream is to just really be a part of the best hospital/hospitalist group in the country. I think outstanding care, I think it pairs with ultrasound. I personally as a very conservative provider. I like to know what my patient has, the second that they have it, I don't like waiting. I think that exquisite care that we want to be able to provide, I think helps with that. Then I think also, when you think about clinical decision-making and any little bit of tools that you can add into that to help augment that, I think it just goes to the words that total reputation of all of our mission areas really.",G1
"Do you see point of care ultrasound is becoming standard of care and in the future, is that different people have asked different expectations with regard to that? Is that something in terms of you, you have some experience with it as a clinician you've heard the conversations about it. What is your expectation of the role of point of care ultrasound in hospital medicine and clinical medicine in the future?","Yeah. I just assume it eventually becomes like the stethoscope and maybe it is the stethoscope. [Laughter] I'm sorry, it's dual functioning. I think the main thing is that ultrasound is now gotten a lot cheaper and accessible to people and so I think that's a big part of it. Whereas before it felt like you had to have like these big machines that cost a ton of money that not everybody could have. I think the second you start to make it affordable for people available where ideally everybody has their own, people at least can get it that day without hassle. 'Cause I think anytime you have a component of hassle, it's not going to necessarily be implemented as easily. I think just the accessibility of it all and then it just keeps getting cheaper and then the image quality keeps getting better. I think those are the things that help make it where it would be. You could just go on Amazon and buy your own ultrasound for hopefully $500 or less.",G1
"Yeah. As a division head in an academic center, you have a lot of partners you have to think about and you have to think about their priorities. When you think about the priorities of the education and clinical education, how do you think that, that partnership—how has your decision to invest or not invest, how is that affected by that partnership?","Yeah. I would say that at least here people are very supportive of the ultrasound. Jeff Connors, Emily, Julia, I think they're very supportive. I think it's, again, that feeling of it's a movement as in, it's not been fully rolled out, but they are very supportive of different faculty members, not only just here, but there was an effort that I think got squished a little bit with COVID, but there was going to be an effort which I think shows that there's like that investment potential. I think from my own personal perspective the thing I've personally grappled with over time is we'll have folks from the outpatient sector come in and do attending. I think people often, at least in my career have thought that that is equivalent, like hospitalists and somebody who comes into the hospital a couple of weeks out of the year that equivalent. I think both groups bring a very unique skillset, but I think where hospitalists can perhaps differentiate ourselves 'cause to me, I look at a hospital medicine as a specialty and then to be told that, ""Well, people can come in two weeks out of the year and you're equally as good and you don't actually add any more value than the other person."" I think each group brings something different, but increasingly, so what we bring is I think ultrasound because more and more people are implementing it in their regular practice. I think the clinical decision-making part is the other key piece that I look back at my own residency. Those things were just not taught and if you're not in the hospital day in and day out, you will not have that skillset. For me, I think it's a great differentiator of our specialty when you think about what are the unique skillsets. If that's the unique differentiator, then that is a skillset, which is valuable to learners.",G1
Yeah. That's great. Then in terms of our other big partner for our division is their hospital. What are their priorities and how does it align with POCUS from your perspective?,"Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think POCUS is not—I think it's on their radar. I think it is not obviously a lot of things have just been—it's been a purely chaotic here. I think everybody has been on survival mode. There's definitely been a lot of attention briefly for sure this summer on financial. It squashed those conversations; I would say a little bit. I think if you were to say, do you think ultrasound is important for patient care? Does it help? They would wholeheartedly say, yes. Can we get ultrasound machines? They've supported that clearly. I think if we asked for more and needed more. I think we could get that. I think what needs to be more shared with them is a big vision of how it could impact really the whole health system. I think because that's how they think increasingly. Is like we're a big health system, we're not just one hospital, and so I think we were starting these conversations like a year ago, or whenever it was. Then it just clearly it was not gonna get the traction because there were just so many other emergency needs, but I think circling back to that proposal that we were building like, here's what this future could be. I don't think they're gonna say no per se, I think that case needs to be built though for what it adds, not only to that health system, but how do you bring that to patients? What's the value from a patient perspective or a patient flow perspective? I would say in general, the hospital is generally supportive of things, if you can build a good story to it.",G1
"Yeah. When I was talking to some other people who talk a lot with administrators or the administrative themselves, they talk about the priorities and the perspective of the people making decisions about programmatic things like this is obviously patient care. Evidence of improving patient care, evidence of increased efficiency, and financial impact on the hospital, and patient satisfaction and then national reputation. Those are some of the priorities I'm hearing about some of these people who are gonna be making programmatic decisions. Do you agree with that in terms of their main priorities or things that they think about when they're making such decisions?","Yeah. I think 'cause a financial discussion always takes a big place in all of this. When I've looked at the outright cost beyond people's time, I'm not sure the infrastructure part, that to me, when you're looking at the budget, that at least our health system has doesn't feel that big, but I think the time that support obviously is probably the trickier part to work in for people. Yeah, I think all of those factors play in, and I think depending on which type of leader or administrator those are weighted more heavy than others, but I think they'll all have to be considered. I think if you were to say, what are the top three, just like at a high global level, ensuring that it does improve patient care, which I think we believe it does, that it expedites care, which I think is also patient friendly. Then for a system that runs more than capacity a huge priority, you see a lot of effort around that and so I would say that's up there. Then the financial part, just because I think if you actually improve patient care and you improve patient flow, the financial gains on those two actually, are so much bigger than the other stuff that we're talking about that I think the financial considerations important, but looking at it in a perhaps different way than we normally say, ""Oh, as a hospitalists you cost X amount of money and you bring in X amount every time you do an ultrasound."" I think that's like icing on the cake, but if you can reduce a hospital'sstay by a day or prevent readmissions or move a patient's hospital cost more quickly and hopefully in a safer way, to me, that's where the bigger financial gain is. I think framing it in that context, which financial people don't like to do, but to me, the numbers are much bigger in that context actually than just, this is how much you could bring in via ultrasound.",G1
"Maybe this is an opportunity for you to explain to me why their perspective on cost is so narrow as opposed to a little bit longer term, since it seems like that they would want the most accurate assessment of costs longer term since they're trying to make a sustainable enterprise. Do you have a sense of that? That's something I struggle with understanding where that's coming from?","Yeah. I'll just say it's not unique to a specific institution. It's been my whole career when I've had to do budgeting stuff. I think it's the easy math, right? It's the direct math where, you know for sure a hospitalist costs X amount and you know for sure that this is what they bring in. It's just very direct, easy math. I think then when you're saying, well, you improve length of stay, and maybe your paid based on a DRG or something and so if you can make it shorter, or more efficient, then you get more money for what you've done. Whereas if it's a lot longer, perhaps you're not bringing in as much as you could. I think it's just a harder, more indirect math that like, you need almost an economist to help with. I've talked to Angela about this. I was like, I just wanna do a programmatic evaluation and with a deep dive from this perspective that it's not just how much we cost and how much we bring in. The whole hospitalist model has been built on better care, more efficiency, but it's really hard math and then I think just as institutions have more pressures for sure financially, it's just hard to take the time to see that. As a provider, you feel it, right? 'Cause you're just like the burnout, the stress of your job. I think that has a cost to it as well. Yeah, this is like my whole life's [laughter] work project.",G1
"Do you think spelling it out? 'Cause one of the things I'd been thinking is that if we knew a little bit more about that stuff and we're able to build more convincing arguments around that, if that was part of our skillset, then maybe that would be the way to show them why we think that that's a better approach to thinking about things. Do you think that that's something worth investing in?","[Crosstalk 14:35] Well, it's gonna be—this is like the research that we do more at a program level not specific to ultrasound and my bigger interest is around workforce and ensuring safe patient loads and things like that. We built a financial model actually looking at when the census rides high, what does it do to length of stay? We actually showed just similar to a paper that was published around 2011, 2012, that the length of stay goes up as your starting census goes up. Then when you look at the costs then per patient, you can imagine that if you could actually get those patients discharged, then you could actually bring in then new patients, you wouldn't have to turn away patients. We actually showed like a cost savings, or even the potential to bring in a lot more money. It was not given much attention and I was just told nobody likes that math. [Laughter]",G1
It wasn't given much attention by like the academics or wasn't given much attention by the people making the decisions?,"That's about everybody I talk to. You know what? We need a movement on this and we actually have a really fun paper coming out at the end of this month that gets at this a little bit, but we're gonna just start paper, project after project, and we're gonna get at it one by one to build the case that this is not the right thing. It's not the right thing actually for the institution either. I think you can actually have it—everybody can win, providers cannot be crispy, patients can get better care, and your patient flow problems, you know what? We're hitting our heads against a wall because they're like discharged sooner, discharged faster, yet they wanna incentivize or tell us to see more patients. I'm like, those too are [laughter 16:24]",G1
"They're mutually exclusive. Yeah. There's only so many. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. That sounds like a related, but a big problem that is an entity in itself.",It's international.,G1
"Okay, but good to know where to put your efforts in terms of what's a short-term strategies and longer-term strategies. What do you see as the potential pitfalls to POCUS implementation from your perspective?","Pitfalls, I don't know that there's anything negative per se. I think it's just finding the bandwidth and the way to incorporate it into people's daily work. How does it become so ingrained in your culture, I guess, and then thinking about what people don't have right now is just added bandwidth, I think. How do you start to build those things? I think you could say it's like ultrasound, it could be research, it could be whatever it is that you're trying to integrate into a culture. I think it just has to be very present in everything that we do, and that it's a clear important part. I don't know that there's a negative thing. I think it's just, how do you in the middle of a lot of chaos add another thing to people's plates and hopefully the chaos is gonna die down, but you can feel when I talk to people that they're just like, I can't take one more thing. How can you integrate it into daily work in some way to with small little bits help with it? 'Cause the one thing I would stay just thinking about just my own career and how I could incorporate it into the work I do, have just about zero free time. I'm running negative hours if I could just like sleep less or something, but I'm personally really interested, but it's like soul crushing to have to go to a conference for many days and then pay for it on the back-end with trying to dig out of all the stuff I'm supposed to do. Then frankly, I just never can protect a whole day anyway. Even when I go to like SHM, I don't actually walk away from work. I'm still working and I go network and I don't attend any meetings whatsoever. That's my life. I think we have a decent number of people in that same situation. It's a number of mid-career people who have other things that's just really hard. Then on the flip side, our younger people are so highly clinical. It's like, how do you work in yet another thing? I think that's the tricky part of it. I don't know that there's a negative downside to implementing ultrasound. The ultrasound machines are increasingly pretty cheap. It's just getting the skillset. Then I think the quality control part of it, is the other big beast to ensure that it's like a okay and if we're doing a good job, so it's just like, I think that infrastructure can be challenging, but hopefully not insurmountable, I guess.",G1
"Great. Besides the folks that we've already talked about, what other disciplines, like, who else are we collaborating with or who else are the stakeholders besides the learners, the education folks, the hospital, who else are we collaborating with in this? An important—","Specifically, or people to think about—",G1
Yeah. People to think about in terms of getting their perspective and their input on what we're doing.,"Yeah. The only thing that I find really interesting about ultrasound is it feels sometimes there's a lot of territorialness. I think in thinking about that, like who are our partners that we don't want to have territorialness with? Radiology, like the cardiologists, anybody who does that kind of thing, even across our own sites, thinking about how if we want everybody to share in this, then we should be arms wide open. How do we all participate? Not also at the same time either take business or have this sense of loss or whatever. I think that's the delicate balance here that I find just really interesting.",G1
"I think we're in a time—my personal sense is we're in a time and place where I'm not feeling a lot of territorialness with my subspecialty colleagues and in fact, for instance, radiology has been incredibly supportive of this work and actually encouraged it to an extent or some of them have. I'm wondering if you have experience maybe at DH or here. 'Cause I really haven't yet?","Yeah. I would say just thinking about a few of the meetings, we've just had where I'm like, you can feel it a little bit. My hope is that radiology is not gonna feel like somebody is taking you something or that the collective educational efforts are shared. I just—",G1
"Yeah. It's subtle. I know, definitely. I guess I'm so used to resistance to that level, I'm like, ""Oh, they'll be okay with that."" It's not like a hard stop, but yeah, you're right. [Laughter]","Defiantly not a hard stop, but you can feel the tension. It's just something I've noticed.",G1
"Yeah. Yeah, but nothing like where you're seeing big boundaries being raised per se, just kind of disease with it.",I just think people are very sensitive to it.,G1
"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. I get that. I'm trying to think. I guess, what would you like to see as a program director, what would you like to see for our division and with POCUS locally, nationally in the next 10 years. What ideally would you like us to accomplish, and then what do you think we can do? I guess.","Well, I've no doubt that whatever we decide we wanna do, we can do. It's not the ability part. Well, you personally—I love that we built that SHM conference and obviously once we can start doing that again. I'm sure that will come back. I think that's great for a large immersive experience. I think the other thing to think about is the people who feel that they have no bandwidth for whatever reason. How do we infuse that ultrasound, where it's constantly at the back of your mind, constantly part of our culture? One guy just like these little small nuggets of educational sessions. Just like even an hour or less where you can say, ""Hey, if you're on service, come we're gonna go scan people."" Maybe it's like a handful of your crew where you just literally take people and everybody grabs an ultrasound, so you can get familiar with it if you're not. Take away that barrier, where do you find ultrasounds? We're just gonna go scan it. We're gonna do real-time learning and discussion. I think those little small little tidbits, constantly throughout the year, well, can it elevate that culture of like, ""Hey ultrasound is what we do as a division."" I think that would be incredibly powerful. I think thinking about then what's an easy path to getting certified and easy being low barrier obviously you wanna have a standard, but how do you make it really accessible? How does every single person, if you walked up to any division member, would be like, ""If I wanted to do this, I know how to go about doing it."" Then I think the other thing, you had alluded to this that could have been just an email. How do we incentivize people? I think if you lower the barriers to learning, I think I've never been a big believer, like I read the end-pink and stuff like that. I think you have to be very careful with incentives. There are some incentives that already exist. You can use this for clinical excellence, for promotion that already exists. That's really easy to do. The scholarship, incentives that the department of medicine built. You can build that into the clinical excellence piece where you could argue really easily. Like Lee and I [laughter 25:21] like, look at those documents so and we're not gonna fight it. That can count towards that incentive that should come back hopefully this year depending on what happens with COVID. I think there's small incentives that people may just not even be aware of to be what I would personally gain is like, I can maybe be a little bit more efficient clinically. I could worry less probably the biggest thing, actually. I think at some point all the younger folks actually are gonna have the skillset and when you're on teaching, they're gonna be like, ""You don't know how to do ultrasound.""",G1
"Yeah. No, I think those are all good thoughts. Thank you for that. I'm gonna turn off the recorders and then we'll just continue that. That's a perfect segue to our next conversation. Thank you.[End of Audio]",[No Reply],G1
